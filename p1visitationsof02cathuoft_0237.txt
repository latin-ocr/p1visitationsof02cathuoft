DORCHESTER ABBEY, 1445 81

order which were made for the observance of regular discipline are not
read : therefore they forget them, nor are they observed.

. Brother John Hakburne, the prior, says that brother Ralph is utterly
in rebellion against the abbot and has never been of profit, and there
will be neither peace nor charity in the convent, as long as he remains
in the house, because he is a very great sower of dissensions in the con—
vent and between the abbot and the convent.

Also the same Ralph recks little of the prior’s corrections nor will
obey him in aught, but is rebellious against his injunctions.

Brother John Redyng says that, whereas the several canons were
wont to receive twenty shillings apiece in the year for their raiment‚ now
in the time of this abbot they receive only a mark.

Also he says that one of the abbots of the monastery did ordain
aforetime that ten shillings should be distributed among the canons for
the celebration of his obit on the eve of blessed Mary Magdalene, the
which distribution is now withdrawn by the present abbot.

Also brother Ralph Charnelle complains that the abbot set
him to minister the divine office and the sacraments in the chapel of
Stadhampton, which was wont to be served by a secular chaplain, where-
from grievous damages followed to the same Ralph, as there followed
for example the charge of guilt touching which he cleared himself.

- Also in the second week of last Lent the same abbot‚ going beyond
the measure of correction, did lay violent hands upon the same Ralph,
striking him with his fist on the face and his staff on the head, so that he
shed blood in both places.

Also on the following night the said abbot did put the said Ralph in
prison without cause. but only of his heart's wrath, in a chamber without
any food.

Also when once the same Ralph was going to his recreation at Stad-

¹ hampton, there fell upon him six men and wounded him and beat the boy

[that followed] him; and forthwith the abbot [did send] six armed men,
who did bring back the same Ralph to the monastery, and when he was
brought back, he put him in prison for twenty days, without precognition
of any known cause and without conviction of the same Ralph, and,
while he was thus in prison, he went without meat and drink ; nor did
the abbot suffer him [to go free] until the same Ralph had promised the
abbot that he would leave the monastery for ever.

Also the abbot and his men did make spoil of the goods which
the same Ralph had at the time of such imprisonment, nor in all the
time ..... was he shaved, [and] all [these things] the abbot does
to the said Ralph, because at his election [Ralph] was not well disposed
to him. ·

The same Ralph prays therefore that my lord will ordain of his
grace that the same Ralph either may have power to go to the university¹
or be able to migrate to another house of the same [order] within a
certain time, wherein to make provision of the place whereunto he should
migrate.

Brother John Clyftone says that Ralph Carnelle turns the order and
its religious observances upside down, because, whereas they ought to
wear a woollen shirt next their skin, by reason of ........ of the
same Ralph they do wear linen shirts next their skin, and tunics fastened
with laceS, whereas, putting aside tumes, they ought to wear ., . . ‚²
