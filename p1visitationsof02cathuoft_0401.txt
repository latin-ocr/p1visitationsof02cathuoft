IRTHLINGBOROUGH COLLEGE, 1442 164

next to come, in the parish church of blessed Mary of the town of Hunt-
ingdon‚¹ · before my lord or himself or other my lord’s commissary, to
hear the declaration, pronouncement and decree of my lord, and do and
receive what further is lawful touching such exhibitions made, there
being present Bug, Thorpe and I Colston. The copy of the said letters
is among the other matters to be noted at the end of this book.²

The same sware before the dean and his brethren, laying his hand
on the gospels of his own free-will, to do nothing that may concern the
college but with the consent of the whole chapter in common ; and yet
he does all things as he pleases without asking the consent of the
chapter, incurring perjury [thereby]. He appeared as above⁸ ; and,
when the article was laid to his charge, denies the aforesaid oath in any
other wisc than the statutes require, and says that by the statutes he is
not bound to ask for the consent of the chapter in matters of business.

Now, when these things had been so done, my lord adj0urned his
visitation in the state wherein it now is until the mori-ow of the feast of
St. Luke the evangelist next to come, and to any day on this side of that
feast concerning which he shall think fit to forewarn the same dean and
chapter, there being present Thorpe, Bug and 1 Colstone.

Sir Walter Lufnam⁴ is defamed for the guilt Of adultery with Agnes,
wife Of John Stonys the elder.

The same sir Walter is defamed for laying his hands with violence
upon sir Richard Smyth, dragging him by his feet down the steps of the
common hall.

The same Walter sware before the dean in chapter of his own will
upon the book that he would never do anything in his office but with
the consent of the dean and chapter 3 the which he never did, and
accordingly is perjured and past correction.

the course of the long process recorded above„ and the slip of parchment was probably the
actual memorandum οἱ indictment employed by the bishop and his commissaries at the
various terms to which his case was successively adj0urned.
