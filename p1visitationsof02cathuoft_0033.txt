INTRODUCTION xxv

[appointed] by God of the goods granted me by the Lord [and] to
make disposition therefor‚² do make and ordain my testament or my
last will in the best and most effectual fashion wherein by law or ot
custom I can, after this manner.

In the first place 1 commend my sinful soul with what devotion
Ι can to Jesus Christ my Redeemer and Saviour and to His most
blessed and most glorious mother and all the saints of God, and I
choose my place of burial in my cathedral church ot Lincoln in the
nave of the same cliurch,² in that place wherein the bishop makes
his station at the time of the p1·ocession.³ Ι will also that the funeral
expenses to be laid out for rne at the time of my burying be not over
large or extravagant, but so moderate that they may not be a diver—
sion for the rich or thern that have abundance, but rather a comfort
and refreshment to the feeble and needy.⁴ I bequeath also for alms
to be had to every poor man that cometh to the day of my burying
or funeral service, iijd., on the seventh day⁵ jd„ and on the thirtieth
day jd. Also to every canon of my church of Lincoln, being my
brother therein,⁶ that is present at that funeral service in his habit,
vjs. viijd. Also to every vicar that is present in like manner, iijs.

is present as above. xvjd. Also to every poor clerk and chorister of
the church in form as above, xijd. Also I will that my executors
make distribution, even as it shall seem good and fair to them, to
men of religion and other priests that corne and are present, and to
the ministers of my church, if any have been left out.

Also I will that my executors pay all my debts fully and faith-
fully, and if [it chance] that any man be hurt unduly in his person
or property, against God or good conscience, by me or mine, that,
when they have learned the truth‚ they make satisfaction to them
that make just complaint.

Also I leave to thirty honest secular priests, to be chosen by my
executors in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in equal
number, if so many may be found in the same without stipends,⁹
but, if not, [then] in other places within my city and diocese accord-
ing to the discretion of my executors, to celebrate for my soul and
for the souls of all those for whom I am bound for a year immediately
following my funeral, if they may be had for that time, [and] other-
wise as quickly as it may be done, a hundred and fifty pounds, to be
