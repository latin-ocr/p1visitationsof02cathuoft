HUMBERSTONE ABBEY, 1440 144

night, dressed in a white tunic. He confesses to so [being there], but

in company with others.
Also he says that the same Gedeney is held in suspicion with Alice

Layceby and Joan Walteham, women of Grimsby‚¹ and they are the

, women who were with him in the chamber of the sacristy, and he applies
» the chrism clothes² to a forbidden use. He denies both articles at any
time. It was appointed him that he should clear himself immediately

’ with one of his brethren: howbeit of [my lord's] favour he cleared

himself on his own unsupported oath ; and he was warned, under pain of
imprisonment for a quarter of a year, to keep away from these women,
and the abbot was enjoined to execute this injunction, if he make
· default.

Also the abbot has the seal ad causas of the convent in his own
keeping without the will of the convent, and has pawned the jewels of
the house, and which or to whom is not known: he carries that seal
with him in his purse. He says that all the jewels are in the house, save
a mazer, which is under detention at Grimsby.

(The abbot.) Brother John Gedeney says that the abbot receives
all things and spends everything by himself without taking counsel with
the convent οι· rendering any account, and that the house, ’ as it is
believed, is forty pounds and more in debt.

(The abbot.) Also he prays that fiax be not sown henceforward
within the precincts of the monastery.

(The abbot.) Brother John Wrauby, only an acolyte‚ who has
abode in religion for five years professed,³ cannot be ordained to further
orders, for that the abbot will not furnish him his travelling expenseS. “
The abbot says that he is not competent in respect of knowledge, and so
the abbot was enjoined to cause him to be instructed.

(The abbot.) Also he says as above concerning the lukewarmness
and carelessness of the abbot, and says that in all his time he has not
seen the abbot in chapter for the correction of transgressions.

(The abbot t he confesseS.) Also he says that the abbot lies not in
the dorter : he eats every day in his chamber with secular folk, and the
monks [eat] in the hall4 ; and that secular folk altogether rule the abbot,
· and he does nothing with the advice of his brethren, so that it is feared
that the common goods are wasted in the abbot's default.

(The abbot ε he denies.) Also he says that the house is grievously
burthened by the kinsfolk and others of the relations of the abbot, etc.
He sware that henceforth he will not suffer [this].

(The abbot : he denies.) Also he says that the abbot defamed this
deponent in public in the presence of folk from outside‚ for a default for
which he was corrected in chapter. He denies the article: howbeit‚

ampliacionem), required all monks to be promoted to all holy orders on notice given by their
abbots, unless they had legitimate excuse. To this end, which the multiplicatiori of chantry
masses in conventual churches made desirable, every monastery which could afford it was
required to maintain a master, to instruct the monks in the primitive sciencie. The position
of Wlany’ who was still in minor orders so long after his profession, was therefore
irregu ar.

and camera see note 3 on p. 92 above ; and cf. the account of Henry 1V's visit to Bardney
in 1406, when the abbot's chamber was reserved for the royal party, while the abbot presided
in his hall over the banquet provided for the rest of the company (Monasticon 1, 625). See
