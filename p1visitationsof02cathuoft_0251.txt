ELsTow ABBEY, 1442-3 89
XIX.

THE vlslTATloN OF THE MONASTERY oE ELSTOW‚ OF THE ORDER OF
ST. BENET, OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN‚ PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE οΝ ΤΗΕ 21ST DAY OF THE MONTH OF
JANUARY IN THE YEAR oF ouR Lonn 14421, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST AND Lonn, 'rHE LORD WILLIAM, ΒΥ THE
GRACE or Gon BISHOP OF Lmeomv, 1N THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR
OF H1s CONSECRATION AND THE SEVENTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
ἓξὲξ 21033323212? 3³52„ssss 12²1 &¹2³3ssss {2¹233³3?{3233354253{¹323ssssss2322?ss
before him in person the abbess and convent of the said monastery, in
readiness as was apparent, to undergo such visitation. And then first
and before all else the word of God was set forth in aceordance with the
process about to take place by the honourable master Thomas Twyere,
student in divinity²‚ after this text, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like
unto a treasure hid in a field '. And when this had been finished
praiseworthily in the vulgar tongue, the abbess ot that place de-
livered the certificate of the mandate which had been addressed to
her for this visitation by my lord to my lord himself. The which having

’ been read through after these words, ‘To the reverend '‚ eto, then the

abbess shewed her title, to wit the certificate of the confirmation of her
electi0n⁸; and then she sware obedience and fealty in the form aecus-
tomed. Thereafter she shewed the state of the monastery and after-
wards the foundation charter of the monastery.4 And then the same
reverend father prooeeded to his preparatory inquiry in this form.

Dame Rose Waldegrave⁵ says that there are five households of nuns
kept in the monastery, whereof [the first] is that of the abbess, who has
five nuns with her ; the second of the prioress, who has two 3 the third
of the sub-prioress, who has two; the fourth⁶ of the sacrist, who has
three ; and the fifth of dame Margaret Aylesbury, who has two.⁷

Also every nun of the house has for her maintenance at the begin-
ing of every week seven convent loaves and six gallons of beer and more.⁸

⁶ The Latin says ‘ third’ by mistake.

⁷ Flemyng’s injunctions (Visitatmns Ι, 50) had recognised a separate table for the abbess
and the nuns ‘quas nouerit magis indigere recreacione'. Gray (ibid. 1, 53) had noticed the
disuse of frater and had ordered that at least two-thirds of the convent should keep frater
every day. The inference is that the division of the nuns into familiae had become habitual
between the two visitations, although no special mention is made of them.

⁸ Archbishop Courtenay's injunctions to Elstow‚ 6 Nov., 1390 (Lambeth Reg. Court-
enay‚ 1, f. 335d.)‚ ordered the supply to every nun on Mondays, Wednesdays ancl Saturdays
of a dish os meat or fish, according to the season, out of the common fund, each dish to be
at least a penny in value and to take the place of eggs, which had been the usual food on
those days. On other days due supply was to be made to each nun from the victuals of the
monastery, according to previous custom. The old weekly supply of beer to each member
of the convent had been, in accordance with the rule of St. Benet‚ cap. 40, seven mensures,
four of the better kind and three of the second and weaker sort. In spite of the fact that
the nuns had decreased in number. this allowance had sunk to the insufficient quantity of
four measures. courtenay increased it to five, stipulating that the abbess should have five
measures of the better kind. He also ordered that no difference should be made between
her bread and that of the convent, the bread being fixed at the accustomed weight. viz.
sixty shillings to the pound. Flemyng's injunction in 1421—2 (Vzsscitatzbns 1, 49) is a brief
repetition of Courtenay's. The mensura of beer in 1390 and 142 t-2 is probably equivalent
tcl>dthe lugens in 1442-3 (see note 6 on p. 14 above), so that the allowance was rising to the
0 stan ar .
