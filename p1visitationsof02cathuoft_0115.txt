BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-8 20

pittancer, [obtained] from John Hert, to construet a building in respect
of the said office.l Let his due be rendered him.

Also he says that the same Bartone, when he is at Boston or Lincoln,²
in the presence of many that hear him disparages the abbot and his
brethren to the great scandal of them and of the monastery.

Also he says that the same Bartone, albeit strong and well, lies every
night not in the dorter but in the infirmary.

Also he says that brother William Croyland and brother Henry
Lincolne after compline are busy drinking long time in the frater, almost
until midnight.

Brother Richard Parteney says as above concerning the debt and
dilapidation of the monastery, the manors, granges and other tenements,
and concerning the needful repair that should be done.

Also he says that the monks in the frater and infirmary are so
sparingly served that after their meals nothing is left for the alms, and so
...... shall be poured on their present works. He believes that by
reason of this default God is visiting them with divisions and differences
and also with scantiness of crops and murrain of their beasts. Also he
says that the abbot who is dead had twelve chargers, twelve pottagers
and twelve saucers of silver that were newly bought,³ and now it is not
known where they are; and he says that he had thirty pairs of linen
cloths in his lodging, and now there are only five.

Also he says that brother Thomas Bartone, sometime sacrist, defamed
this Parteney, who was then sub-sacrist, of having broken open a chest
in his office‘* and stolen certain goods out of the same ; and once, when
he spoke touching this to the said Bartone, he said ⁶ Hold your tongue ’,
at another time, ‘You are busy enough' : he prays therefore that he may

· clear himself before my lord concerning this.

Brother Thomas Bartone, nowusub-cellarer and almoner and of late
pittancer, filches from the convent certain payments which he should
pay to each one year by year out of the same office of pittancer.

Also he says that the chantries of Hartsholme,⁵ Skendleby and
Partney are, as he believeS,÷not served as theyfought to be.

Brother Thomas Elkyngton, the cenaret, prays that all the monks
may eat together in one building outside the frater.6

Also he says, as regards the sees and salaries 'of the officers in the
monastery, that the abbot has furnished my lord with a paper which
contains all these at length.

Brother John Rose, deacon, says that a young layman who dwells
with the abbot did most foully browbeat and scold this deponent, and it
is notorious [that] this youth, by name Taylboys,⁷ is upheld by the abbot
against the young monks.

Also he says, as above, that the chantries of Partney and Skendleby
and the others are not served.

 

⁴² lm. in the sacristy. Officium in these visitations is used rather confusingly both for
the office itself and the building belonging to it.

⁵ In Boultham parish, close to Lincoln. See Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports, xxxn, 46, 47.
