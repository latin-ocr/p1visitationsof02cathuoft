KYME PRIORY, 1440 , 173

you do not suffer boys of such an age and such a kind to have, as is
wont, their comings in and goings out through the midst of the quire in
time of divine service ; for sometimes they that are singing the psalms in
quire are disturbed by such doings.¹

Also we enj0in upon you the prior, under the same penalties‚ that
as quickly as by all means you can you do levy the rents assigned to this
end and cause the wonted distributions at obits to be made without
delay, and [cause to be distributed] the accustomed pittances‚ which are
now [coming] into disuse.²

Also we enj0in upon you the prior that, On the same days whereon
the common folk are accustomed to make Oblations at the high altar in
your church‚ the priest who is celebrating shall go with his ministers to
the western door of the quire and receive at the same the Oblations of
them that desire to make offerings‚ that the same secular folk, especially
women, may not enter the quire in time of divine service.³

Also we enj0in upon you the prior, under the same penalties‚ that
you do suffer no secular folk whatsoever to sit of custom in the frater or

your hall at meai-times mingled with ,the canons at table, save only at
your own table.⁴

We will also and enj0in that at the times of the noontide meals in
both places you shall have reading.⁵

Also we will and ordain‚ under the penalties written above and
beneath, that your canons, when they stay at Northolme‚ shall abide
together continually and live in common by night and day in that
dyvelling-place which has been ordained for this use in that place from
O old.⁶

Also we enj0in, etc. (as in the eighth injunction for Wellow and
from this place to the end.)‘²

THE VISITATION OF THE PRIORY OF LANGLEY, OF THE ORDER OF ST.
BENET, OF THE mocESE OF LINCOLN‚ PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE ON THE 20TH DAY OF THE MONTH oF
JANUARY, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1440‚⁸ ΒΥ ΤΗΕ REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD W1LL1AM, ΒΥ THE
GRACE OF GOD BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF
H1s CONSECRATION AND THE F1FTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father in Christ was sitting in
his capacity of judge at the beginning of the business of such his visitation
on and in the day, place and year abovesaid, there appeared before him
the prioress and convent of the said priory to undergo, as was apparent,

 

4 Founded on Durham's seventh detectum.

⁵ An addition, the reason for which does not appear in the detecta, to the preceding
injunction. Itis obvious that the indiscriminate presence of lay-folk in the frater would
hinder reading.

⁶ Founded on Feltwelle's first dez‘eclum.

⁷ The injunctions for Wellow (undated) will be found in their place in Visitalions 111.
Those referred to here require the yearly rendering of an account by the prior, forbid
unlicenced grants of corrodies (see Durham's seventh detectum), and order the injunctions to
be read four times a year. The visitation ol Wellow had been held three months before, and
the five sets of injunctions, all undated‚ were probably composed at the same time, after the
visitation of the archdeaconry had been completed.

⁸ Le. 20 jan„ 1440-1.
