William, 1 by divine permission bishop 01 Lincoln‚ to our beloved
sons in Christ the prior and 31111--1111012 and convent 01 1116 priory 01
Daventry 01 1116 order 01 St. Β61161,01 0111 diocese, that now are and
shall be, health, grace and blessing. In the progress of our visitation
as ordinary which we 116 31 present holding in our archdeaconry 01
Northampton and in its churches both regular and secular and the
clergy and people 01 1116 same, we, coming down 111 person to you and
your place, even as also to 1116 0111613, and making anxious inquiry
touching the state 01 your priory and 01 5101113611163ζ> found almost no
good among yzou nay, verily, religion among you is altogether dead
and your temporalities, without which this present 1116 cannot 116
carried on, are on the way to lose their being. And desiring there-
fore the revival 01 religion among you and the more 1111111111 governance
01 your temporalities henceforward for your advantage and profit, we
do altogether in these writings suspend you the prior from all adminis-
tration of any temporalities 01 1116 said priory whatsoever on account 01
your old age and bodily incapacity, and because we see with the assur-
ance 01 0111 eyes that the religious discipline and temporal matters of
your said place are on the way to come to naught, and also inasmuch as
during your whole time you have rendered no account 01 1116 adminis-
tration 01 1116 goods 01 1116 said priory in accordance with your rule,
enjoining you in virtue 01 obedience and under pain 01 contempt and the
pain 01 excommunication, which, 11 you do not that which we command,
we intend to proclaim against your person, that hencef01ward you do
refrain altogether from all and all manner of administration 01 311611
matters temporal, and that you and you,⁸ our beloved son the sub- -prior,
do give your attention 111 person by night and day to the regular observ-
ances and to the chanting 01 1116 divine office by day and by night in
quire and elsewhere, and to the due observance 01 silence at the due
1101113 and places according to your rule ; and that you, prior, do roam
neither in the orchards, woods, copses, outer gardens⁴ or fields without
taking in your company a fellow monk 01 ripe age and discretion and a
secular person 01 good fame,⁵ that you may have witnesses of your
behaviour, 1116131116 whereof is grievously blackened until now by reason
01 your roamings by yourself.6

Moreover we enjoin and command you all and several that now 316
33(1 shall be, under pain 01 1116 excommunication aforesaid, that every day,
as soon as compline has been sung, wholly refraining from 311 manner 01
drinking and eating, you do go all together to the dorter and your beds,
to go out from thence in no wise until the bell be rung 101· prime on the
following day, save only to chant matins at midnight.⁷

Also we enjoin and command you all and several, in manner and
form and under the penalties abovesaid, that you do altogether observe
the hours 101 meditation and study in cloister every day according to
your rule, lest that old enemy, who seeketh whom he may devour, find
you idle
