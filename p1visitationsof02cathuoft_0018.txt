x INTRODUCTION

The quires vary in size from two sheets to eight. As will be seen
from the table of contents below, they were made up gradually, and
quires which contained blank leaves after the completion of one set of
visitations were re-used at a later date for another. Eventually the
quires were put together and the -leaves numbered. Owing to a mistake
in the original foliati0n‚ they have been re-numbered recently, and the
new numeration has been adopted in the present edition, in which also,
for the sake of convenient reference, the visitations have been arranged
in the alphabetical order of the houses visited. The Roman numerals in
brackets given after the title and date of each visitation in the following
table are those prefixed to the documents as they are printed in this and
the succeeding volume.

Quire 1, four sheets. The leaves are numbered ff 1-9, owing to the
inclusion of a schedule (fo. 4). The second half of the second sheet (fo.
8) is a half-leaf, which has been cut in two vertically before use. The
contents are as follows. Ff. 1·5d‚ Peterborough abbey, 10 Dec., 1437
(Lvn1); ff. 6-7, Markyate priory, 7 May, 1442 (XLIV) ς ff. 7-9, Irthling-
borough college, 29 June, 1442 (XXXIV), with a schedule between ff. 8
and 9. Fo. 9d is blank. Ff. 3d and 5 are not in Colstone’s hand, owing
to the employment of three notaries at the Peterborough visitation ; and
the schedule (fo. 4) was apparently written by another notary for the
prior of Peterborough. The Irthlingborough visitation begins on fo. 7,
immediately after the conclusion of the Markyate document. On the

⁴ back of the half-leaf (fo. 8d) are some cancelled memoranda of citations

made in connexion with a visitation of the archdeaconries of Lincoln
and Northampton.

Quire 2, three sheets. The leaves are numbered ff. 10-15. Fother-
inghay college, 23 Sept, 1438 (XXII). Ff. 14, 14d, and 15d are blank,
with the exception of an irrelevant memorandum of one line written
on 1 d. 1
{nire 3, eight sheetS. The leaves are numbered ff. 16-31. The
contents are, first half of quire: ff. 16-17, Bardney abbey, 17 March,

injunctions. Between ff. 24 and 25 an undated schedule relating to
Garendon abbey (xxm), has been pasted in. Ff. 16d, 18d, 20d, 21d, 22d,
23d, 27d, and 31d are blank. It is evident that before the second half
of the quire was used in 1444 and 1445, the sheets of which the first

halves are ff. 16 and 17 were wrapped in their wrong order with the ⁷

sheet of which the first half is fo. 18 outside those of which the first
halves are ff. 19 and 20. The Bardney visitation of 1440 on fo. 17 is
