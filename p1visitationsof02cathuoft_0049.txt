INTRODUCTION xli

June, 1446: 1, Wooburn3 3-10, Liddington; 11, Wooburn; 15-22,
London ς 27, Liddington. Of this there is little to be made; but dates

⁵ from Wooburn, which Alnwick regarded as a suitable residence in early

summer, usually carry some conviction with them, and there is very little
indication that Wooburn, like Liddington, Buckden, N ettleham and the
Old Temple, was a permanent centre for official business.

July‚ 1446 z 2-8, London ; 14, Wooburn 3 21-23, Liddington.
Wooburn is again significant, but the evidence for the bishop’s move-
ments during this month and the next is extremely scanty. He was
certainly at Cambridge, however, on 25 July‚ 1446, when the foundation-
stone of King's college chapel was laid. August supplies only four dateS,
6, 7 and 19, Liddington, 31, London. September was certainly spent
(5-19) at Buckden: there is corroborative evidence in addition to the
other dates in a visitation of Peterborough abbey on 10 September.
Again in October, all the dates, such as they are, are from Buckden, with
the exception of Peterborough, to which Buckden was the nearest
episcopal residence, on the 5th. November gives us: 9-11, Buckden;
26-28, Liddington. We know that on 3 December the bishop was at
Liddington in person. He appears to have stayed there till about
17 December and to have moved to Sleaford for Christmas about the 22nd.

Until 6 February, 1446—7, all dates are from Sleaford. From 7-9
February, the bishop continued his adjourned visitation at Peterborough.
He then seems to have returned to Sleaford (14 February), while from
19 to 28 February dates are from Nettleham and Lincoln.

Early in March, 1446-7, Alnwick again visited Cambridge. There
is a premature date from Cambridge on the 6th ; but the probable course
‘of his journey was as follows: 6, Nettleham; 7, Stamford; 12, 13,
Cambridge; 16, Buckden; 17, Lincoln. He now remained at Lincoln
or Nettleham till about 15 April, or possibly as late as 24 April, 1447.

v· There are, however, dates from Sleaford on the 23rd and 26th. Sewstern

on the 28th supplies the intermediate stage by which we arrive at Lidd—

ington on the 29th. The bishop left Liddington about 4 May, was at
·’ Buckden on the 5th, and at Cambridge from the 7th to 9th. Here, on
f the 7th, he took part in the consecration ot John Langton, master of

Pembroke hall, as bishop ot St. David's in King's college chapel.¹ The
remaining dates for May are: 11, Sleaford ; 30, London-neither of
which is very conclusive.

Equally vague are the dates for June : 3-14‚ Liddington3 17,
Sleaford ; 19, Buckden; 23, Stamford3 27-30, Liddington. July gives:

Ἰ. 2-14, Liddington ; 16, Sleaford; 19, 28, Liddington. We may perhaps

assume that Alnwick returned to Sleaford from Cambridge, and possibly

Ϊ did not appear personally at Liddington until after 23 June. The

Buckden date in June and the Sleaford date in July may be discounted.

5 August gives: 1, Liddington; 13, 14, Nettleham3 17, Sleaford: 22,

Rothwell²z 30, Buckden.

In September and October, 1447, there are indications of a visitation
of part of Huntingdon archdeaconry. The dates for September are:
5, London (probably non-personal) ε 7, 9, Buckden; 11, 12, Bluntisham ;

 

¹ Reg. xvm, fo. 67.
Β Probably the place of this name in Northamptonshire.
