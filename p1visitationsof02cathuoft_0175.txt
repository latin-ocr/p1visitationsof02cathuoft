CATESBY PRIORY, 1442 50

⁴ therefore she was declared to have made default in purgation, and,
having advanced nothing, she was pronounced to be convicted‚ and
forswore the said man and all familiar converse with the same hence-
forward.

Isabel Benet confesses her crime, but not with sir william Smythe.
Notwithstanding she forswore him and all familiar converse [with him]
henceforward, and has the morrow to receive her penance. Thereafter
she cleared herself with Juliane Wolfe, Elizabeth Langley, Alice
Holewelle1 and Alice Kempe.

As to the lights‚ the prioress says that they shall be provided.

As to the chaplains, the prioress says that none can be had; she
will do her diligenee that they be had.

And then [my lord] adjourned his visitation to the morrow, there
being present Depyng, Thorpe and I Colstone.

My lord ordained that there be two [nuns] receiverS‚ to receive
and to pay out [the money to be kept in a chest] under three locks²;
and that all live in common, leaving off their separate households, and
that these things do begin at Michaelmas next. And all were warned
to remove all secular folk from the dorter on this side the morrow of
the Assumption.³ And all were warned under pain of excommunication
that none do reproach another by reason of her disclosures. And the
prioress was warned to [shut] and open the doors of the church ancl
cloister at the due times, and to keep the keys with her by night in the
dorter. And then he adjourned his visitation to Tuesday next after the
feagtlof St. Andrew next to come, there being present Depyng‚ Thorpe
an Colstone.

 

 

Dames Isabel Benet and Agnes Halesley,⁴ nuns ot Catesby, will not
obey or hearken to the injunctions of the lord bishop, and especially
that concerning giving up their [private] chamberS,⁵ asserting that they
are not subJect to the same. '

Also the said dame Isabel on Monday last past did pass the night
with the Austin friars at Northampton and did dance and play the lute⁶
with them in the same place until midnight, and on the night following
she passed the night with the friars preachers at Northampton‚⁷ luting
and dancing in like manner.

⁵ The reference is to injunction 8 below, and shews clearly that this evidence reached
the bishop some time after the visitation had taken place. By injunction 10 Isabel and
Agnes had been appointed receivers of the convent, and they may have claimed private
ehambers as checkers necessary for their office and therefore exempt from the class con-
demned in injunction 8. Their visits to Northampton are also explained by their office, as
they would act as the cellarers of the house and do its external business and marketing.

Β The actual instrument may have been the cittern (earlier called the estole), which
had wire strings like a harp and was played with a plectrum. The lute had gut strings and
