INTRoDUcTION xxxvii

from 17 July to 16 August at earliest.¹ September is again a puzzling
month. N ettleham and Nottingham are found on the 9th. Nottingham
on the 10th‚ Nettleham from the 14th to 18th, Sleaford and Liddington
on the 19th, Sleaford from the 10th to 26th, Liddington from the 27th
to 3 October. This is obviously a double set ot dates, from which
nothing definite can be concluded‚ apart from a probable visit to
Nottingham.² October, from the 9th to the 27th, seems to have been spent
in London, from which Ankerwyke priory, visited on 10 October and
again at the end of the month, was accessible. Alnwick's relations with
his Buckinghamshire archdeaconry are not easy to discover; but he may
have made a visitation of the archdeaconry during one of his visits to
Wooburn, a favourite place ot' residence with him.

There is again some difficulty as to November, 1441. The dates
are: 5, Oseney ; 9-16, London; 20, Buckden ; 22, Liddington ; 27,
Tattershall castle and London (an impossible combination)³; 30, Lidd-
ington. Still, apart from the London date on the 27th, these dates may
stand. Liddington was certainly Alnwick’s head-quarters from
4 December at latest to 17 January, 1440-1, at earliest. The dates
Buckden (11 December) and Sleaford (26 December) are discountable
upon the theory of double sets ot dates already enunciated. There is an
excellent illustration of this theory during the period 1441-2. It is
probable that from 28 January until the beginning of May, 1442, the
bishop was partly in London, partly at VVooburn. There is only one
document (25 February) dated from Wooburn, while dates from London
are fairly continuous. But the bishop's passage to and fro is marked by
three occurrences of Beaconsfield, viz., 14 and 23 February and
17 March. On 14 Feb.. however, in addition to the date from Beacons-
*field‚ there is one from Lincoln ; and, on 15 Feb.‚ there is also a duplica-
tion of places, Lincoln and Buckden. The dates ot‘ these documents,
collected, it must be remembered, at a date some time after they were
written, for transcription into the register, may be wrong ; but, assuming
that they are right, they clearly show how much business, irrespective of
the bishop's personal movements, was transacted by his clerks and
officials. This is illustrated again by dates from Nettleham on 14 and
18 April, {ind by one from London on 10 May, atter Alnwick had gone
northwar s.

For the summer of 1442 his movements are clear and interesting.
He left London by 7 May, when he visited Markyate priory. Next day
he was at Northampton, and on the 1oth at Liddington. From 18 to
25 May we find him at Sleaford, and from 29 May, when he paid one of
his many visits to the dean and chapter of Lincoln,⁴ to 16 June at

 

 

¹ But it is certain that he was at Daventry on 15 July, 1442, so that the date in this
case is probably a year wrong.
Β Nottingham lay outside the diocese, and Alnwick may have gone there on public
Rusiqelsls· It is hardly likely that Nottingham‚ which occurs more 1han once, is an error for
ett e am.
⁸ Alnwick’s visits to Tattershall are doubtless explained by his friendly relations with
Cromwell, who was atthis time engaged in establishing his college of chantry-priests in
Tattershall church. See note 5 011 p. xxxv above. It seems probable that Cromwell had by
this time completed his great works at Tattershall castle. He proceeded about 1441 to
build his new house at North Wingfield (see note 1 on p. xxxiii above). It is clear from the
{reamble os his will and from the architectural details of the building that the church oi
attershall was not rebuilt until some years after his death in 1456.
