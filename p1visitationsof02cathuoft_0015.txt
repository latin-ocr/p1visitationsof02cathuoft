INTRODUCTION

Ι.

THE documents which are now published for the first time have

hitherto received little attention. They have been utilised for

the purpose of necessarily brief summaries by the writers of the
accounts of religious houses in the Victoria County Histories οἱ Lincoln-
shire and Oxfordshire, and, so far as they provide material, of Bucking-
hamshire3 but their existence seems to have been unknown to the
authors of similar articles in the histories of Bedfordshire and North-
amptonshire.¹ The present editorgghas elsewhere summarised those
portions of their contents which relate to the religious houses of
Leicestershire² and to Bardney abbey.³ Their general character is
discussed in the sequel ; but some prefatory description of the MS. in
which they are contained is desirable.

The MS. consists at present of seventeen unbound folio quires⁴ of
paper, 12 in. by 7} in., containing 135 leaves. These appear to have lain
for many years with other diocesan papers in the Alnwick tower at the
Old Palace in Lincoln, and have suffered considerably by damp and
⁸> decay. Originally there seem to have been sixteen quires and some
loose leaves ; one quire of two sheets and probably one leaf have been
lost, which brings the original number of leaves up to 140. In compara-
tively recent times the margins and other torn portions have been
mended with considerable care by pasting slips of semi-transparent
paper over the broken parts ; loose leaves have been formed into quires
in the same way, and the sheets have been secured in a portfolio, with a
written label, ⁴ B1sn0p ALNwrcK's V1S1TAT10Ns OF MONAs‘rEmES. clneA
1437·1446,’ pasted on the back. Unfortunately, the method of mending,
though carefuL was primitive, and has made the faded writing extremely
difficult to read through the super-imposed paper. The handwriting
throughout is very small and close, and is, for the most part, the well-
known hand of Thomas Colstone‚ notary public, who was registrar to
the bishops of Lincoln during the whole of the first half of the fifteenth
century. Interleaved with the text are a number of small schedules‚
containing matter bearing upon the visitations, which have been separ-
ated in some cases by the mender from their proper context.

 

1 The material which the MS. contains for the portion of Hertiordshire which was in
the archdeaconry of Huntingdon is inconsiderable, nor are there any visitations of the very
few religious foundations in Rutland. Histories οἱ the religious houses of Leicestershire
and Huntingdonshire have not yet been printed in the Victoria County Histories.

⁴ The word quire is here used in its most general sense for the sake οἱ convenience.
As will be seen, the folded sheets in each quire vary in number, andronly quires 1 and 14

are the regular quaternions os four sheets each.
