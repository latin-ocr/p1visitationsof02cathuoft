CRoYLAND MoNAsTERY‚ 1440 58

CROYLAND.

In the year of our Lord 1259 it was appointed and provided, under
the presidency of dan Ralph the abbot, who ordained it with the
unanimous agreement and assent of the whole convent of Croyland, that
the master of the work for the time being should keep a horse in the
stable with its equipment for the need of the monks, and that the same
shall himself receive in its entirety all the tithe of wheat, that is to say
from Nomansland and from Bretherhouse and Cotes and from the moor
and so within the mcor-gates.l

CROYLAND.²

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the abbot and convent of the monastery of Croyland, of
the order of St. Benet, of our diocese, that now are and shall be, health,
grace and blessing. Inasmueh as we ought by all means to cherish holy
religion where it is planted, in no case do we fulfil this better than in
taking order with all our might to nourish those things which are right
and to correct those which hinder the advancement of virtue. When
therefore we came down to you, that we might see, as our charge is, if
all things were well with you,3 and performed in that place the office of
our visitation as ordinary, we found certain things, albeit few, yet meet
for some reform. Therefore we despatch to you the underwritten our
injunctions and commands, to be observed without breach under the
penalties written beneath.

In the first place, since in such our visitation we have discovered4
that it was reported to us that one and the same man, to wit, brother
Richard Fryssheney, does hold both the office of the priorship of your

. cell of Frieston, under whose presidency there should be continually

resident therein nine brethren doing service in quire day and night, and
also the office of the claustral priorship⁶ in your monastery, and [that] it
would be a very good thing if separate persons were set over both
offices, seeing that in both places there is a serious charge involved3
and the same brother Richard, presiding over the cure of the said cell,
has for a long time received the profits thereof, and has left the rectory
houses and the chancels of the appropriated churches that are appropriated
to the uses of those abiding in the same cell to lie in a visible state of
dilapidation, and by reason of his office of the priory aforesaid is in debt
to several persons for considerable amounts, and has rendered no
account, at any rate in full, of which there is certainty, of his administra-
tion done by him in respect of the goods of the said cell ; we therefore,
considering that, inasmuch as any man fulfils the cure of his own soul with
difficulty, much more hardly must he be able to accomplish that of
several souls entrusted to him with the administration of goods in divers

 

 

as defined in the early charter, lay to the west os the ‘ aqua de Nene ’ and north and south
{flghel Wegland, the northern marsh being known as Goggislaund‚ and the southern as

er oun .

² The injunctions begin here.

³ An allusion to Gen. XXXVII, 14. Cf. p. 40 above.

⁴ These earefully composed injunctions belong to the class in which the comperta are
given in detail in every case. The detecta on which they are founded can be easily identi-
fied without special reference.

⁶ The prior claustralis is the prior in an abbey, to be distinguished from the head of a
priory, whose disciplinary duties in cloister were delegated to the sub-prior. See Visit-
ations, 1, 244, 245, note on Prior.
