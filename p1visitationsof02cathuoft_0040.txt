xxxii INTRODUCTION

Of the earliest documents, the few dated from Lincoln were probably
issued by the vicar-general in the bishop’s name ; ‘while those
dated from London must have emanated from the bishop hlmself. It 15
fairly clear that he cannot have been at Kirby Bellars in Leicestershire
on 6 Nov, 143613 while a document dated at Dunstable on 15 March,
1436-7, takes its place between two London documents of the 14th and
16th, and therefore is more likely to mark the movements of one of his
clerks than his own. At any rate, he seems to have remamed in London
after the restitution of his temporalities on 16 Feb., 1436-7,2 until about
Lady day. On that day a document is addressed from Eynsham,
to which again some uncertainty attaches, and it is not until three days
later, when we find him at the palace of Lincoln, that we can determine
upon his whereabouts with confidence. 28 March, 1437, may 00 taken
as marking approximately the date of his enthronement at Lincoln.

The next date, Oxford, 17 April, 1437, is hard to explain 3 but from
19 April to 2 August the bishop appears to have taken up his quarters at
St. Leonard's priory, outside Stamfo1·d.⁵ He may have been in London
for a time at the end 01 April, and on 24 June there is a date from
Liddington, which is only some twelve miles from Stamford. In August
he moved westward, and we obtain a puzzling series of dates which is
obviously wrong, viz. 13 August, Leicester ; 14, Daventry ; 15, Leicester ;
20, Canons Ashby priory. The Daventry date should probably come
somewhere between 15 and 20 August. No records of any visitations of
the priories at Daventry and Canons Ashby for this date remain. On
23 August the bishop was at Buckden. On 31 August there is a date
from London, but on 6 September he was again at Buckden, had moved
to Sleaford six days later, and evidently went from Sleaford to Lincoln
for his primary visitation of the dean and chapter, which occupied the
first eight days of October.⁴² Buckden, 9 October, is probably a clerk’s
or commissary's date. Stamford, 11 and 21 October, seem more
genuine 3 and no doubt can be cast upon Shene, 30 October. The
bishop appears to have been in London, at his house in the Old Temple,
for most 01 November, in spite of a doubtful claim for Stamford on the
17th, and to have gone to Buckden a little before the 26th. It was from
Buckden that he made his visitation of Peter-borough abbey on 10 and 11
December. This is the earliest visitation of this series 01 which the
mmutes remain.

As Hitchin occurs on 20 and 21 December, it is possible that Alnwick
spent his second Christmas as bishop 01 Lincoln in London. He was in
Lincoln, however, during a large part of January, 1437-8, and, while
there, made the first of his interesting visitations of Bardney (26 and 27

manors and with Buckden and Liddington was easy.
