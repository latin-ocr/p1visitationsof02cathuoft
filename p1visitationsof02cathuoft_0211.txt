· OF ST. AUST1N‚ OF THE mocESE OF LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE ON THE 27TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF
MARCH, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1441, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM‚ ΒΥ THE GRACE
OF Gon BISHOP OF L1NOOLN, ΙΝ THE 15TH YEAR OF H1s CONSECRA-

TION ΛΝΒ THE F1FTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the beginning of the business of such his visitation‚
on and in the day, year and place aforesaid, the abbot before all elsel
delivered to the said reverend father the certificate of my lord's mandate
which had been addressed to him for the business of such visitation,
after these words, ‘TO the most reverend‚' etc. And when this had been
read through, the same abbot shewed my lord the title of the confirmation
of his election and left copies with the registr-ar, of the certificates both
of his confirmation and installati0n23 and then the abbot sware to my lord
canonical obedience and sealty in the accustomed form. The same abbot
also shewed the foundation charter of the monastery and likewise left
copies [thereos] with the registrar. And then my lord appointed tO the
same abbot the term, at the third hour after nones of the same day⁸ in
the same place in the presence of him or his commissary‚ for exhibiting
the full state of the house and for doing and receiving what else is lawful.
And then the abbot, being examined, says these things which follow.

Brother John Clyftone‚ the abbot‚⁴ says that, as far as regards the
governance of the temporal affairs Of the house, while it was in the hands
of certain canons of his appointment, the house was in debt in large and
heavy sums; and therefore one Marmyone has the direction of such
temporal affairs with the consent of the convent.

Also he says that, as he believeS‚ the house to-day is g6o in debt
and something more.

Brother John Hakebmne, the prior, says that the abbot does not
shew the state of the house, and makes no reckoning in common ot his
administration, nor has ever made reckoning.

Also he says that secular f01k‚ both male and female, have often
passage through the cloister precincts to the church‚⁵ and this almost of
custom.

Brother John Henrethe says that no fixed hour is Observed for
rising to matins, and this because the prior, albeit he fills the office of
the sacristship, takes no care of the clock which this deponent did

⁵ The conventual buildings at Dorchester have disappeared, with the exception of the
foundations of some of the outer buildings and a 17th century school-house, which probably
stands on the site and incorporates some of the masonry of a guest—house. They were on
the north side of the nave of the chureh, which, with the south aisle added c. 1320. was used
by the parishioners. There is no trace in the north wall of the nave of the usual western
processional doorway, and the only direct entrance from the cloister at this time was the
doorway in the west wall of the north transept, which opened into the church close to the
pulpitum. See plan in Archoeol. J0urnal LXVII, 333. The proper entrance for parishioners
was in the west bay of the south aisle: this was covered by a porch in the 15th century,
illustrated in F. Bond’s English Church Architecture 1, 258.
