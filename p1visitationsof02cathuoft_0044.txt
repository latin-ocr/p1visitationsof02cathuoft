xxxvi INTRODUCTION

6-12, Lincoln, and 14, Sleaford, are rather suspicions dates ; but 15-30,
Liddington, may be taken as right.

January, 1440-1. 8, Liddington ; 11, Kibworth ; 19, Breedon priory;
20, Langley priory ; 21. Gracedieu priory ; 22, Garendon abbey.l This
concludes the Leicester dates, and accounts for two more deaneries,
Gartree and Akeley. The south-western and western deaneries of
Guthlaxton and Sparkenhoe were probably taken between the 11th
and 1 th. ,

Fliom February, 1440-1, there is a series of dates so puzzling as to
be well-nigh baffling. In February the bishop appears to have gone
from London (8-15) to Buckden (19) and Liddington (20). The March
dates, however, give London (1-4), Sleaford (6, 7,), Nettleham (8),
Liddington (9, 10), Sleaford (11), Nettleham and Lincoln (17-23). Out of
these contradictory details, a short visit to Lincoln may be fairly inferred.
On 27 March, 1441, we have an indisputable visitation of Dorchester
abbey, and next day the bishop was at ‘Wat'lyng,’ probably an error sor
Watlington, or, it may be, Wallingford. He also appears in London on
the 28th, which 0311 hardly be right, as he was at Buckden on the 3lst,
and London would have been out of his way. But the dates, ⁴ Byllesfeld,'
i.e., Bitchfield, near Grantham, for 1 April, and Huntingdon (4 April),⁴
are irreconcilable with straightforward progress. Again, Lincoln and
Nettleham occur on 13, 14, 31101 19 April, but London comes in the way
on the 15th, and Liddington appears on the 25th. This question, compli-
cated by the Bitchfield-Huntingdon problem, is past settling.² The
bishop, however, was certainly at Lincoln on 24 April.³ Despite the
intrusion 01 Nettleham on 15 May, there is some case for London from
the 5th to the 19th of that month, and we are on sure ground at
Wooburn from 21 May to 13 June. During this stay, Alnwick visited
Dorchester abbey a second time on 1 June, so that we can confidently
reject a document dated from Lincoln on that day as affording any
evidence of his personal doings.

He either spent June at Wooburn or varied his residence for a short
time between Wooburn and London. The dates are: London 22-26
June ς Ἦο0011111 29 June—8 July ; London 11-13 July. Daventry,
15 July, however, indicates that the London dates may be those of his
clerks in his absence, and that he may have journeyed from London by
way of Daventry to Buckden, where we can safely conclude that he was

 

¹ See note 3 on p. 112 (no. XXIV). As Garendon was a Cistercian house and therefore
exempt, Alnwick’s visit was made merely to claim the rights 01110311113111)1 due to a bishop

⁸²· A possible'solution is that the date assigned to Bitchfield is wrong and that he was
there after 4Apr11 on 1113 way to Lincoln. Liddington (25 April) probably marks his return

Alnwich was not likely to ‘oe absent from this function. Huntingdon on 4 Anril may thus

to some time between 4 and 13 April. The date from Cambridge, 3 April. 1440, noted ’
