FoTHERINGHAY coLLEGE, 1438 93

In the first place, as the said reverend father on and in the said day,
year and place was sitting, at the beginning of such the business of his
visitation, in his capacity of judge as a tribunal, first and before all else,
while there stood by the master, the perpetual fellows¹ and the other
ministers of the said college and many others in no small number, the
word of the Lord was set forth by the honest master Thomas Duffelde,
bachelor in divinity, after this text, ‘Visit us in Thy salvation ', etc. And
when this had been finished in praiseworthy fashion in the Latin tongue
and all whom such business did not concern had been removed, sir
Richard Vautort,² master of the said college, proffered to the said rev·
erend father the certificate of my lord’s mandate which had been dis-
patched to him for this business, whereof the purport is on this wise,
‘To the reverend father in Christ ', etc. The which certificate having
been publicly read through by me, the notary aforesaid,⁸ to them, after
they had been called over and were present, first the master sware can-
onical obedience and shewed the foundation charter of the college⁴
under the seal and signature of master Thomas Sale [and] the statutes
written in a quire of parchment.⁵ He exhibited also his title in the said
college, but left no copies, nor did he exhibit the state of the college,
because, as he says, he has not yet continued for an entire year in the
complete administration of the goods of the college ; and, after the year
is entirely past, he will be ready to exhibit such state. And then the
precentor of the said college and thereafter the several perpetual fellows
of the said college in priest's orderS, to wit one after another, sware
manual obedience to the said reverend father bodily, touching the book.
And afterwards the same reverend father proceeded to his inquiry in the
business of such his visitation and examined and made inquiry of each
one touching the state of the college. And they, upon such examination
and inquiry, do say and testify these things which follow.

Richard Vautort, master of the college, says upon examination that

Redburne ; and this utterly against the statute to which they are sworn,⁶
to the end that he should be altogether driven out of the college, albeit
he is very needful to the college in the office which he holds in the same
and there is no—one who knows or is able to prove the contrary.

Also he says that sir Richard Assheby at another time, in the days of
Richard and William, late bishops of Lincoln, did abjure familiar con·
versation with Emmot Masone of the same,⁷ married woman; and yet
he constantly haunts, as was his wont, her fellowship and conversation,
notwithstanding the oath aforesaid. He appeared and, the article being
laid to his charge, denies his guilt and familiar conversation with the
said Emmot ; and he was enjoined to clear himself at once with three of

abstinence from detraction, strife and quarreling.
