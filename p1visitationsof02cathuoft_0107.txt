BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437—8 16

prays therefore that my lord do see it and ordain a remedy. Let the
vault in the quire be pulled down during next summer.²

Also he says that the dorter, frater, cloister and the other buildings
of the monastery are much dilapidated, in so much that the rain comes in.

Also he says that, since they are few in number, they have no
scholar at the university, wherefore he fears that they will be fined at
their general chapter.2 They are not twenty in number ε therefore they
are not bound to this charge. Therefore‚ even if they be fined, they
should pay nothing.

Also he says that the injunctions made by divers lords bishops in
their divers visitations held in that place to further the healthy govern-
ance of the monastery in things spiritual as well as temporal are hidden
away and are not brought out in public, so that nothing is known of
them ; and so the good governance of the whole monastery is going to
naught. Let those that were last made be shewn.³

Also he says that the abbot is very simple, but is of no account in

⁴ temporal matters, but he is much ruled by brother Thomas Bartone.

Also he says that, when he first came to be a monk in the monastery,
one monk used to have more in his dish than three have now, and yet
the house is now discharged of debt none the more and after meals there

, is nothin left.

Alsoghe prays that each several monk be put upon a fixed allowance
of his own, and then it will be seen whether the monastery is in debt by
reason of the excessive expenses of the convent or of the incompetent
governance of its presidents; because he says positively that when my
lord last came they had in the frater only two sorts of fish, to wit,

X*herrings and salted fish, in so small a quantity that nothing was left over.

Also he says that, unless my lord lay his hand thereto‚ the monas-
tery in a little while will be in danger of final extinction.

Also when guests come to visit the monks, they shall have nothing
whatever for their retreshment from the kitchen, and this in default of
brother Thomas Bartone the cellarer⁴ ; but one Graystok of the town of
Bardney shall have of the same brother Thomas whatsoever he will, and

- if any of the monks shall say ‘ Do service to us even as you do to him ,'
then they have nothing in answer but abuse. He says that this Graystok
is his serving-man and his wife ......

Also he says that the old monks are set alike with the young to-tasks
in quire and frater, reading and singing‚ and in [this] the old are spared
no more than the young.

[Also] that the young monks are somewhat rebellious and saucy in
their answers to their elders.

[Also] he says that after the abbot had received my lord's inhibitory
mandate for the holding of his visitation in that place, the same abbot at
the suggestion of brother Thomas Bartone, who was then almoner, sub-
cellarer and pittancer, did absolve the same brother Thomas from his

tokfficgzaglfepittancer and did put brother William Croyland in his place in

 

 

⁵ The inhibitory clause of the bishop’s mandate would take some such form as this
(from York Reg. Bowet, f. 83d.‚ etc.) : “Vobis insuper tenore presencium inhibemus ne a
fhe recepcionis presencium, pendente negocio huiusmodi visitacionis nostre, quicquam quod
m dicte visitacionis preiudicium cedere valeat attemptetis.'' The removal of an obedientiary
from his office after the mandate had been received was in direct violation of this clause, as

istscresult would be to screen his faults from detection and lay thern on the shoulders of his
cessor.
