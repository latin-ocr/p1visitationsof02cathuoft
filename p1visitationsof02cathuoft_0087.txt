such his visitation, and then bade the prioress and convent of the said
place be called before him; who all appeared before him in person.
And when they thus appeared, the same reverend father, the process
previously had and done in such business and also the adjournment of
the same visitation having been first recited by him and acknowledgedgby
the same nuns, put forth in detail and rehearsed to the same prioress
article by article all that had been discovered to him concerning the
prioress and touching her. The which things having been put to her,
some, to wit, the same prioress confessed and some she denied, even as it
is written down at the end of every article ; and touching her denials, so
far as they concern dilapidation and so involve deprivation, my lord de·
creed that inquiry should be made after summons of the same prioress and
the others who ought to be summoned for this purpose, reserving to him-
self the power of proceeding against her as regards the rest according to
her answers and the process held concerning them. And because the same
prioress complained of sister Margery Kyrkeby in that she had called1
the same prioress a thies, the same Margery, being judicially impeached
touching this, expressly denied the charge and cleared herself thereos on
her own witness alone. Afterwards‚ because the prioress confessed that
for a long time past, even for very many days and years she had had in
her only keeping the common seal and very many, even almost all, of the
archives of the house, my lord ordained that all these should be kept in
one chest under two looks, of the keys whereof the prioress should wear
one, and sister Margery Kyrkeby, chosen to this end by the convent, the
other ς and that nothing should be sealed with the said seal unless with
the advice in common and the agreement of the sounder and more part
of the convent and in the chapter-house; and until provision of such
looks should be made, my lord caused that common seal to be shut up in
a little box under his own seal. And then the same reverend father

warned the said prioress, in virtue of the obedience proffered by her, to ⁴

admonish [and] correct in chapter her sisters who are any wise in fault,
not in the hearing of any secular folk, in motherly and sisterly and
temperate wise, and noways severely, as has been her wont, and in all
other respects to treat them gently and supply and cause to be supplied
to them raiment and habits and bed-clothes and nourishment in
sufficiency. He also enjoined upon the several members of the convent,
under pain of imprisonment, that they should humbly obey the prioress
in all lawful things and pay her reverence and shew her honour, nor any
disobedience or despite. And because the young nuns asked that a
governess in reading, song and the regular observances should be

instruct them in good manners and in no wise so that they go contrary
to the prioress in aught. Thereafter he enj0ined upon the prioress in
virtue of obedience that henceforth she should not admit that nun of
Hinchinbrooke² either into the house or to dwell among them, and also
that she should not deliver to her that bond which she has from the
house of Hinchinbrooke or any other goods which she has of the same
house, but only to the reverend father himself. And these things being
done, the same reverend father adjourned the business of such his visit-
ation, or rather the same visitation even as it then stood until and unto the
last day of the month of April next to come and to any law day on this
