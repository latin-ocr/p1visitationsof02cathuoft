been noted earlier,¹ may have been to assert the exemption from epis-
copal authority which the abbey had enjoyed for a short time before
abbot Repyngdon's elevation to the see of Lincoln; but the canons
made no attempt to support him and willingly gave evidence against
him, while Alnwick declined to admit evidence from the abbot himself
on the ground of his contumacy. The charge of sorcery was fully
proved against him, however, and he narrowly escaped deprivation.
Alnwick was at all times unwilling to proceed to this last resort, and,
even at Dorchester, where he himself was patron of the house, the abbot
in 1441, John Clyfton, in spite of his scandalous life, was merely
suspended from all administration of temporal goods, which, by a doubt-
ful expedient, were committed to the charge of a lay steward.2 Of the
dangers attaching to lay stewardships the first visitation of Fotheringhay
college offers a conspicuous example³, and the steward at Dorchester had
already laid himself open to accusations which hardly seem to justify his
a ointment.

pp In the prescription of penalties and in the admission of purgations
Alnwick was merciful and easy. This may be seen by reference to the
visitation of Humberstone abbey,⁴ a small house where discipline was in
an advanced stage of decay and five monks had gone into apostasy within
recent years. Only five monks were in residence, so that, where any
charge was denied and purgatiori was required, the choice of compurga-
tors was extremely limited. Although the monks were ready to supply
abundant detecta, they were equally ready to corroborate one another's
innocence; and the chief offender in the convent, who confessed to
several charges of neglect and irregular conduct and received light
penance, was allowed to clear himself of a serious charge upon his own
unsupported oath. At the secular college of Irthlingborough,⁵ where
complaints and counter-complaints were freely made, the sub-dean,
Walter Luffenham, stood accused of a number of misdeeds. When,
however, an accusation of adultery was brought against him and he was
ordered to find four compurgatorS‚ the dean and three other canons came
to his assistance, in spite of the fact that three out of the four had laid
information against him on other grounds ancl that all were under
suspicion of conduct unbefitting their profession. Nevertheless, when it
came to a charge of violence inflicted upon one of them by Luffenham
some years previously, the offended person refused to support his denial
and he was obliged to confess. He endeavoured to screen himself by
alleging that he had incurred excommunication for celebrating mass
after the deed had been performed and while he was still under the
defamatory charge, but that bishop Gray had absolved him. A few days
later, at Wellingborough, he was unable to exhibit his certificate of
absolution. After various appearances before the bishop and his
commissaries, as preliminaries to deprivation, he produced letters of
absolution under the signature and seal of the papal collector in England.
After this there was nothing more to be done than to submit the letters
to examination by the bishop, whO, so far as can be gathered from the
