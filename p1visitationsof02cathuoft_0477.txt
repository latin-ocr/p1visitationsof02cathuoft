LEICESTER, NEW COLLEGE, 1440 202

Also, inasmuch as it has been disclosed and reported to us that
several of the canons of the said college, the which we relate with
sorrow, do celebrate their masses hardly once in the week, we· therefore
enjoin upon you that you dispose yourselves to celebrate, and celebrate
more often, being so disposed, seeing that you ought to make prayer and
offering for all them whose alms you receive every day, and nothing in
respect of sacrifices can be of more avail than the body and blood of
Christ, nor may any offering be preferred to this, inasmuch as it excels
all.l

Also we enjoin upon you all and several the vicars of the said church
that now are and shall be, under the penalties as above, that, while you
shall be present in quire in time of divine service, you refrain utterly
from all chattering‚ laughter and noise, and keep due silence altogether,
and, if you must say aught, let it be done with all speed in a low voice
and in Latin, taking heed that at that time you are standing in His
presence of whom it is said ‘ His place is established in peace ' ; and
whosoever from henceforth is apprehended to have transgressed herein,
let him pay, apart from the penalties aforesaid, fourpence from his
fcornmons to the common fund of the vicars on the Saturday next
ollowing.²

Also, seeing that in the statutes aforesaid express cautionis given
that the poor ailing folk who have been received into the almshouse, if
they have recovered and are able to seek their living with their hands,
should straightway be turned out and other infirm foll< substituted in
their stead, and [seeing that] it has been disclosed to us that several
who have been so received have now recovered health and seek their

’ living by their own toil, both within and without the college, as hirelings

for reward, and do so heap together riches for themselves contrary to
the intention and import of the statutes, we therefore enjoin upon you
the dean, in virtue of obedience and under pain of contempt, that you
forthwith shut out such, if any there be, as have recovered, as is afore-
set, of their ailments, from the payment they receive from the house and
from the house itself, and take order to substitute others without delay
according to the effect of the statute published touching this.3

(Also because it has been disclosed and reported to us that women,
even of unseemly report and ill reputation, have common and often
access late and early to the houses of certain canons within the close of
the said church, by reason whereof there is bred scandal to the college
and the persons thereof ; in pursuance therefore of the statute uttered
touching this, we enjoin upon you the dean and canons who now are
and shall be, under the penalty of such statute, apart from the pain of
the excommunication abovesaid, that from henceforth you observe with-
out br)each the statute aforesaid according to the form and effect of the
same.

Also because it has been disclosed and reported to us that certain of
the canons of the said collegiate church leave the dwelling-houses
