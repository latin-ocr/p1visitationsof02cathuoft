William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the abbot and convent of the monastery of Bourne, of the
order of St. Austin, of our diocese, that are now and shall be, health,
grace and our blessing. By inspection of our registers composed in the
time of the lord Richard of honest memory, late bishop of Lincoln, our
predecessor, we have found that the same our predecessor, what time he
performed the office of his visitation in the same your monastery,
conveyed to you under his seal some certain injunstions for the good

’ Α governance of the said monastery in the regular observances thereos and

in the other matters that affect the advantage of the house, to be kept
by you, the purport whereof, together with a modification² of them, even
as it seemed needful to us while we were visiting your monastery, we
also convey to you to be observed without breach. Now the purport of
such injunctions as modified by us, as is aforeset, follows [and] is on
such wise z Richard, by divine permission, etc.⁸ You therefore all and
several that now are and shall be we straitly enjoin and command under
the penalties above written, the which also by the purport of these pre-
sents we re-enact, that such the aforeset injunctions all and sundry,
according to the detailed contents and our modification of the same, you
do observe without breach and every one of you do observe in future.
Moreover⁴ we enjoin upon you the abbot, in virtue of obedience and
under pain of contempt, that with all diligence and wariness you cause
that brother Thomas Witham, your canon and brother, who, as it is said,
is living in the outer world in apostasy and in the secular habit, be
sought for and recalled and brought back to his cloister 3 and that you
take care so to treat the same, when he has been brought back, in
fatherly wise and with brotherly love according to your regular observ-
ances, that you may have joy, he of his return to the fold of the Lord,

and you of your prodigal son that was lost and is found. Given under
our seal in our manor of.⁵

 

¹ No deposition is given. The note may be intended to call attention to the occupa-
tion of two offices by the same person, which, though not uncommon, was irregular.

² Strictly speaking, an addition.

³ This endorsement of previous injunctions is unique in this series of visitations, and
speaks well for the general condition of the house.

⁴ Alnwick’s modificacio follows. It will be noted that it is framed as a special injunction
bearing on a special case, and that no attempt was made to reduce it to the general language
{high is usually employed in such documents to meet future contingencies of the same
'm .

⁶ Possibly Nettleham may be intended, as Alnwiek was in Lincolnshire during a great
part of this summer. Owing to the scanty information in his register‚ his movements can-
not be followed with complete accuracy. See introduction.
