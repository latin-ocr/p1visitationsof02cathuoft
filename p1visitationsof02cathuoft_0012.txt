vi PREFACE

vicar of Wraysbury‚ Bucks.‚ and the Rev. H. E. Salter, fellow of
Magdalen college, Oxford, for answers to queries.

Finany, in the somewhat arduous task of editing a work from
which he has often been called by other occupations‚ he has con-
stantly had before him the thought of two friends to whom in the
past he has owed much encouragement. To Thomas McAll Fallow‚ the
author οἱ many admirable accounts of religious houses in The Victoria
County History os Yorkslzire, who died in November, 1910, his earliest
interest in this special type of ecclesiastical document is primarily due.
Robert Meyricke Senjeantson, rector of St. Peter's, Northampton, and
the historian ot the churches and religious houses of that town, read the
early proofs of the present volume up to the time of his death in Nov-
ember, 1916; and the editor had no more powerful incentive to his
work than his intercourse and almost daily correspondence for nine
years with one who, as parish priest and student of history, gave his life
and talents to the service of his neighbours. To the memory of these
two scholarS, alike in their devotion to historical truth and in their
unselfish readiness to share the truits ot their researches with others,
this contribution to a subject which was ot unique interest to both is

dedicated.
