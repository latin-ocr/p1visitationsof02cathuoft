THE VISITATION OF THE PRIORY OF THE NUNs OF FOSSE‚ oF THE
ORDER OF CiTEAUX, OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN‚ PERFORMED
IN THE CHAPTER-HousE THERE ON THE S1xTH DAY OF THE
MONTH OF APR1L‚ IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1440, ΒΥ THE
REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM‚ BY
THE GRACE OF Gon BISHoP OF LINCOLN, IN THE FOURTEENTH
YEAR OF H1s CONSECRATION AND THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the which business, as the said reverend father was sitting on and
in the same day and place in his capacity of judge‚ there appeared before
him the prioress and convent of the said place to undergo, as was appar-

else the word of God was set forth after this text, ‘ Ι come seeking fruit,’
etc. ; and when this had been finished in accordance with the process that
was about to take place and also [as beseemed] them that heard it‚² the
prioress delivered to my lord his mandate which had been addressed to*
her for such visitation. in lieu of a certificate, since she has not a clerk to
write the certificate. With the which my lord was satisfied and ordered
the prioress to shew the title of her incumbency, the foundation charter
and the state of the house; and there and then she exhibited her confirm-
ation and the mandate for her installation and the foundation charter of
the house, but she shews no evidence of her installation.⁸ She says that
all her sisters now present were then present at the time of her install-

cistercian abbey. Faringdon is in Berkshire. Baumburghe is probably Baumber, Lincs.‚
as Bamburgh, Northumberland, seems too far away. Dewly is uncertain, but suggests
some name of which the Latin form is Dei locus.

² This probably means that the sermon was in English: cf. the visitation of Elstow
(no. xlx above). The ignorance of Latin in the monastery is shewn by the inability of the
prioress to return a certificate.

⁸ The date of her election does not appear: see Visitations Ι, 159. No chartulary of
Fosse remains τ a charter οἱ confirmation granted by Henry 111 in 1236 states the foundation
