imprisoned for debt which they have contracted or incurred by
missortune at sea or from thieves or in any other unavoidable way,
and not by their own ill rule ; in the repair of the roads and bridges
in my diocese and the relies of houses of the poor1 ; and that they be
not divided among my executors, to be disparted and disposed among
the same sever-ally, but be gathered together and laid in one sure
place or more, even as it shall seem advantageous to them in that
behalf. And that, after an inventory has been made by them, they
appoint a deputy from themselves or another serviceable man at my
costS, to be chosen by themselves in agreement, for the sale of the
goods who shall answer to them all for the receipts under constraint
of an oath. The which receipts shall be kept in a sure place, to be
laid out and administered by my executors aforesaid according to
the disposition and purport of my present will.

Also Ι will and ordain that my goods, to be disparted and sold
by my executors or any one of them to be deputed, be not handed
over or delivered, even to be looked at, outside the place wherein
they shall be laid up to any buyers, of whatsoever estate or condition
they may be, unless they pay a price in ready money² beforehand
and without delay. ·

Also, seeing that cruel greed so greatly fills the hearts even of
priests of the Lord and, which is more to be wondered at and
lamented, the hearts ot those who are raised aloft upon the pinnacle
of the episcopate³, that they care not with what pains they may
refresh, albeit they do not quench, the thirst ot their avarice, so that
[as regards] ⁴ the goods of their predecessorS‚ on the ground of want
of repair of dilapidation which they pretend that the same have left
undone or have caused in the demesnes of their churches or
bishoprics, they exact money from the goods of the same deceased
contrary to all justice, and wring it from the executors who [grant
it] on account of cowardice and the favour which they show rather
to the living than the dead, in so immoderate and excessive a quan-
tity that the last wills of the deceased cannot be sulfilled, even in
respect of such things as are left from the residue for the use of the
poor or for other pious reasons, (and to neglect to withstand their
perverse ways is nothing else than to encourage them) 3 lest there-
fore Ι may seem, to the peril of my soul, to lend consent to anyone
that shall succeed me and be willing to go astray, which God forbid,
but that I may seem rather, as much as in me lies, to stand in the
way of so great a crime that I may not become a partner in guilt, I
will and ordain that my executors give to such my successor in my
