reverend father and read through at his bidding in the general hearing,
and the said abbot and the canons having been called by name and

preparatory inquiry in the same his visitation. Now thel? purport of the
said certificate is on such wise : ‘To the reverend father in Christ ', etc.

Brother Alan Batesone, the abbot, being sworn, examined and
questioned, says that brother Ralph Carnelle1 is defamed of incontinency
with the daughter of Thomas Robyne of Stadhampton, with the which
woman he was taken in manner suspect; and he says that the same Ralph
is the destroyer of all religious discipline and good behaviour in the
monastery. On the 24th day of May the man appeared before my lord
in the chapter-house, and, when the first article had been laid to his
charge, he avers that he cleared himself before the abbot; the which
the abbot confesses and since denies

The same brother Ralph is disobedient to the abbot as regards his
lawful commands and makes conspiracies with the young canons against
the abbot and against the institutes of the rule.

The same brother Ralph takes the young canons out of the monastery
by night to eatings and drinkings in the town with women and other
secular {01k; and, that he may be able to go out freely, he breaks the
doors, windows and the other wooden enclosures of the monastery.

Also if the abbot says to the said Ralph or enjoins anything upon
him for his offences, straightway he breaks forth into words of abuse,
despising and reviling him 3 and he is very unbearable in the house.

Also, when the same abbot, because of the infamy² of the crime
aforesaid, had delivered the same Ralph to prison, the same Ralph by
'means of his own did bring in students from Oxford, who so frightened
the same abbot that, by force of fear, he was compelled to deliver the
same Ralph from prison.

The same Ralph did lay hands of violence, in a case not allowed by
law, upon brother John Hakburne, the prior of that place, striking him
upon one of his ears with so great violence that thereafter he became
deaf in the same ear.

Brother Walter Dorchestre speaks of the infamy of the crime which,
as it is said, was committed by the said Ralph with the said woman.

The same Ralph is oftentimes clothed in a doublet of defence³ and
wears long knives privily beneath his habit, by reason whereof the canons
are afraid of [death] or of the maiming of their limbs.

And when these things had been thus inquired into and the abbot and
convent had been called together, the same reverend [father] adjourned
such his visitation until the Monday then next to come, to wit, the 24th
day of the said month of May in the same chapter-house, etc., master
John Depyng and I Colstone being present. And meanwhile master
John Depyng and [John Beverle]y proceededto make inquiry of the
rest. ’

[Brother] . . . Pirytone says that the late sir John Draytone,
knight, did give to the monastery certain lands and tenements in Burcott⁴

² Infamia is of course used in its special sense, implying the state of a person who is
defamatus de aliquo crimine. See Visitations 1, 2 34.

⁸ Probably a gambeson or quilted jerkin, worn beneath his canon's habit. The knives
would be stuck in the belt which fastened the jerkin at the waist.

⁴ Burcott (Bridcote) is nearly two miles north—west of Dorchester on the way to
Abingdon, and isin the parish of Dorchester. v
