¹ Verbum Dei omitted.
2 St. Matt. vl, 33.
³ Interlined above quinque cancelled.

¹ The buildings of the college of Irthlingborough‚ apart from the curious arrangement of
living· rooms in and adjacent to the tower, a massive square structure crowned by a tall
octagon, at the west end of the chureh, from which it is divided by a poreh and a vestry
with an upper story, have disappeared. They stood on the south· west side of the chureh,
near the tower. For a general description of the chureh, see Architectura! Notices of tlte
Churches of the A rchdcaconrjv ofNorllzampton, 1849. The tower is described by W. Talbot
Brown [in Associated Architectural Societies’ Reports and Papers xxvll, 117·23. The ten
stalls which remain in the chancel correspond to the number of foundationers, viz. six canons
and four clerks

2 The full number as required by the foundation. See the letters patent of Richard 11,
12 March, 1387- 8, printed 111 Monasticon VI (3),1384which state the desire of John Pyel
to erect the parish church of St. Peter of Irthlingborough into a collegiate church and found
therein a college‘ sex canonicorum, quorum unus decanus esset.’

³ Thomas Othemoor (i. e. o’ the Moor), priest, was inst. to a canonry and the third
prebend‚ 11 June, 1410 (Reg.x1v‚ fo 244). He quitted this prebend on admission to the
deanery, 24 May, 1415 (ibim, fo 261). He appears to have resigned the deanery about 8
July‚ 1446, when John Blaunchard, who resigned the deanery 111 1453 (Reg. xx, fo. 166),
resigned the church of All Saints, Irthlingborough, and Thomas More was inst. in his stead
(Reg XV111, fo. 135d.). He vacated All Saints by death before 7 Feb.‚ 1446· 7 (ibid., fo. 136d).
Of the other canons mentioned 11616, Walter Luffenham os Yaxley, priest, was inst. 20 June,
1421 ( Reg XVI, fo. 5 5d ). He and the others evidently occur in order of seniority No inst.
of Richard Smyth remains: he died before 17 Sept, 1444 (Reg.XV111,fo.132a'.). It will be

noticed that Walter atte Welle, mentioned in the opening paragraph of the visitation‚ does ”

not occur again, his place being taken by William Blokley. ‘'Walter is probably an error
for‘ William‚' while‘ atte Welle‘ is doubtless Blokley 5 alternative surname. It may be
noted that William Attebrzgre exchanged the vicarage of Guist, Norfolk, foracanonry, 4
May, 1432 (Reg. XVII, fo. 22d.)· he resigned, however, in 1434 (diat, fo. 42), but may
possibly have been re admitted. ‘Walter atte Welle' may thus be an error for‘ William
atte Brygge. ' William‘ Bloke' died before 8 April, 1449 (Reg. xv111, fo. 115..d) John
Burton was inst. 18 Dec., 1441 (ibid0fo.127): he resigned before 28 April, 1449(i'.,b1d fo.
