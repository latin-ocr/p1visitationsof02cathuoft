places at a distance from one another, give commission to you the abbot
and command you that, 31161· 1116 account of the administration of the
same brother done in respect of the goods of the said cell has been
audited by you, and when it has been seen by you that the repairs of
such houses and 6113116615 be duly done, and satisfaction has been made
by him to everyone to whom he is bound by debt, you take order with-
out delay either to charge him with the office of the priorship of the
said cell only, so that he may reside therein in person, or, having removed
him from that office, to put another in his place, who shall perform the
cure 01 1116 531116 6611 111016 happily, lest the cures of the same monastery
and cell be neglected in any way whatsoever by one who may not 116
31116 to preside in both places with profit.

Also seeing that, as has been premised, nine monks beside the prior
have been wont to reside 6011111111311)1 111 1116 531116 cell, who 311, except the
cellarer, ought continually to attend quire, and now only six abide con-
stantly therein, we enjoin upon you the abbot that you do put in their
place and appoint as you are disposed as many monks in the same as
may be profitably, seemly and fitly maintained out of the goods of the
same cell, when its other charges are subtracted.

Also since it has been disclosed to us, as regards certain matters
which we have discovered to be contained in the archivesl of the said
monastery, that the almoner is bound to provide two horses with fitting
equipments, and the pittancer two like horses, and the master of the
work one like horse with their equipments, maintained at the costs of
their offices, and the chamberlain to keep six comely cloaks always in
readiness for the monks when they go a journey, and the said almoner,
pittancer, master of the works and chamberlain do now refuse to meet
such charges, we enJ'oin upon you the abbot, in virtue of obedience and
under pain of contempt, that by our authority, the which we commit to
you in this behalf, you do straitly compel the said almoner, pittancer,
master of 1116 works and chamberlain to meet the aforesaid charges.

Α150 3111611, even as it has been disclosed, there is in the office 01
1116 almonry a house which is called ‘the susterehouse’, wherein the
parents 01 1116 monks and the serving-folk 01 1116 monastery who have been
reduced to old age or infirmity or to loss 01 vigour or wretchedness in
other respects by worldly misfortune, have been wont, of the laudable
custom 01 1116 monastery, to be provided for and maintained out 01 1116
311115 01 1116 monastery, that house is now turned to 3 wrong use because
01 3 66113111 greediness, we enjoin upon you the abbot, in virtue 01
obedience and under pain 01 contempt, that you do restore that house to
its erstwhile use without delay, considering that the duty 01 piety where-
upon you are founded is to pity and help the wretched in their afflictions.

(Also since, 01 1116 laudable custom of the said monastery, a monk
who has been in religion for forty years is not wont to be appointed to
the direction of temporal affairs, we therefore enjoin upon you the abbot
that, if such be the custom and any 01 50 great an age be deputed to
such [duties], you do discharge them so that they may spend their time
in divine matters with less disturbance, [unless] in your judgment the
advantage 01 1116 monastery may be more profitably seen to by such, the
which at any rate we have thought fit to leave to your 601156161166).2
