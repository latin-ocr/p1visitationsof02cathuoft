BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-ss 21 θ

Also he says as above concerning the scanty supply of victuals for
the monks in the frater and infirmary, insomuch that after their meals
nothing is left for the sustenance of their serving-men or for the alms,
and this in Bartone‘s default.

Also he says that Bartone lies every night in the infirmary without
lawful cause.

Also he says that the injunctions made by the last my lord of Lin-
coln in his visitation are not observed in aught, nor are they shewn
publicly in the chapter-house.

Also he says that by the careless and imprudent governance of
brother William Croylande and the others who heretofore have filled
several offices the monastery is burdened with grievous debt: he prays
therefore that my lord shall discuss how it stands with the monastery in
this case.

Also he says [that] Bartone the sub-cellarer every day gives to one
Graystoke of Bardney victuals out of the goods of the monastery, in
great abundanee daily, albeit the same Graystoke is not in receipt of a
corrody nor is a household servant of the monastery.

Also he says that the abbot has impawned silver pieces1 and other
jewels of the monastery to sir Robert Boston‚ vicar in the quire of the
chureh of Lincoln, and, as he has heard say, the abbot sold a coppice of
the monastery called Horsley, or at any rate the more part of the same,
without the knowledge or consent of the convent.

Also the abbot freed a neif² of the monastery who dwelt in Southrey,
to the which [neither], nor to the next exchange or sale were summoned
the four young monks who are deacons³

Dan John Hawton says that in default of a barber every monk of
the monastery shaves his fellow.⁴
Also the same deposeS, as before, concerning default in shewing the
injunctions publicly.
’ Also he deposeS, as was deposed before, concerning the total with-
drawal of the celebration of the chantries.

(For. . . .) Dan William Yorke, late the holder of the office of
sub-cellarer, prays that my lord would give him leave that he may levy
the arrears of his office and may be able to satisfy those to whom by
reason of his office he is in debt and in arrears with money.

(Against the woman at Southrey.) Also he says that it would be of
advantage to the good fame of the monastery and of the monks who are
for the nonce in their seynies at Southrey that Agnes Busshe, an un-
married woman dwelling in the manor there, be wholly removed from
that place and some honest man be set in her room to keep ward over
that place. Let the injunction be made.

(For the vessels in the frater.) Also he prays that someone from the
kitchen be charged with the guardianship of the wooden vessels which
belong to the frater‚⁵ and that he wash and clean them when needful.

 

 

2 A nativus was a born serf, the son of two serfs or of a servile mother. See Ducange,
ξῦν. ’
³ It does not appear when the statute requiring the presence of young monks as
witnesses on such occasions was passed, but it seems clear that the reason was that junior
representatives of the convent should check the action of their elders, which may in times
past have been a source of complaint.

⁴ Cf. Gray's injunction concerning the barber, Visitations ι, 2.

⁵ Le. the wooden dishes, plates, etc„ used by the brethren at breakfast and supper.
