of the appointment‚ however, make this doubtful. The abbey of Syon
belonged to the Bridgetine order of St. Saviour, which, like the Gilber-
tine order, provided a body of nuns with the services of a body of canons
regular, living under the rule of St. Austin in their own separate cloister.
The head of the canons was called the confessor; and the charter of
foundation, which appointed the first abbess of Syon, appointed as con-
fessor ‘brother William Alnewyk, in priest's orders, likewise professed
of the order aforesaid.'¹ This requires the supposition that, between
1411, when he was still a secular, and 1414-5, Alnwick entered the order
and made his profession. ,It is just possible that he may have been
allowed to do this on the understanding that, having put the affairs of
the house in order, he might return to the world ; if so, he took a very
short time over his work, as only a month later, in April, 1415, he was
seeking leave of absence from his living of Goldsborough to study at
Cambridge. The supposition, therefore, is at variance with probability.
We do not know when he entered the royal service or when he was
ordained priest, but 1414-5, when, so far as we know, he was still a clerk
attending upon Stephen Scrope, seems too early for either. The con-
fessor at Syon must have been a man of some prudence and experience,
whom Henry v had learned to trust3 and, while it may be conceded
that Alnwick in 1414-5 already showed signs of administrative skill, and
that the occurrence of his name in this particular context is at least a
singular coincidence when his future relations to the Crown are considered,
the identity is anything but likely. It seems much more probable that
the confessor of Syon was William Alnewyk, at a later date ‘ reclusus
monachus Westmonasterii,' who was for a year, about 1428, in charge of
the nuns subject to the abbey of St. Albans. We know that Thomas
Fyscheburne, who preceded him in this post, went to Rome on behalf of
⁶ the holy house of Syon' ; and nothing is more probable than that
. Alnewyk was appointed on his recommendation and subsequently retired
to a solitary life near the palace of Westminster.² ’

To sum up the perplexing and contradictory evidence for Alnwick’s
career before his preferment to the archdeaconry of Salisbury in Decem—
ber, 1420, we can trace his progress as a secular clerk with some certainty
from 1411, nine years earlier. It may be conjectured, but without much
likelihood, that in 1414-5 he temporarily entered a religious order for
certain specific purposes, but quitted it when those purposes were accom-
plished. But there is absolutely no evidence to shew that he was ever a
Benedictine 01· Premonstratensian. In fact, it' we accepted the various
people called William Alnwick between 1408 and 1420 as one and the
same person, we should commit ourselves to the extraordinary theory
that a Premonstratensian in 1408 became an Austin canon of the Bridge-
tine order by 1414- 5, and a Benedictine by 1420 ; and that, in the course
of this remarkable progress, he was at intervals a beneficed secular clerk.

During the ten years of Alnwick’s tenure of the see of Norwich, he
was noticeably active in his efforts against the Lollards of his diocese.
In 1428 he attended the council at St. Paul’s which deliberated the
advisability of imprisoning heretics in monasteries. Subsequently he
