THE VISITATION OF THE MONASTERY OF HUMBERSTONE, OF THE
ORDER' OF ΤΗῙΒΟΝ,8 OF THE DIOCESE OF L1NcoLN‚ PERFORMED
IN THE CHAPTER-HOUSE THEREOF on THE SIXTH DAY OF THE
MONTH OF JULY, IN THE YEAR OF ouR LORD 1440, ΒΥ THE REV—
EREND FATHER m CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM‚ ΒΥ THE
GRACE OF Gon BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR
OF H1s coNSEannoN AND THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANsLATmN.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the business of such visitation, on and in the day
and place aforesaid, there appeared before him the abbot of the said
monastery and four monks 3 and then first and before all else the word
of God was set forth by the reputable master Thomas Duffelde, after
this text„ ‘Thou shalt visit thy brethren, to see if they fare aright and
with whom they are set in array‚’ etc.⁴ And when this was done, the
abbot delivered to my lord the certificate of the mandate which had been
addressed to him for such visitation‚ after these words, ⁴ To the reverend‚'

sub regula sancti Benedicti, cuius ordinis professores monachi fuerunt et eorum habitus
grisius color erat' (Couclzer book os Furness‚ ap. Monasticon v, 246). Fourteen English
houses and one Irish house of the Savigniac order became Cistercian (Hone, lee Abbey of
St. Mary in Famem, p. 2) ; but Humberstone was not founded till after this surrender, and
its mother house of Hambye, although possibly founded before 1148, adhered ιο the con-
gregation of Thiron, of which the Savigniac congregation was an independent branch rather
than a corporate member. Humberstone, like Kelso in Roxburghshire‚ another Tironensian
house, was usually regarded at a later date as Benedictine3 but it seems to have retained
special peculiarities of habit (Visitations 1, 71). Dueange, s.v. Ordo griseus, quoting from
Jacques de Vitry‚ mentions the grey habit adopted by the monks of Thiron to distinguish
them from the ordinary Benedictines.
⁴ In A.V. ‘ Look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.'
