draw water from the conduit.1 He prays that such access may be
restrained.

(Against the prior.)² Also secular folk have general access through
the great gates of the priory and through the cloister into the parish
chureh, especially on Sundays and feast-dayS.³

(Against the prior.) Also he saysthat almost every Sunday or feast·
day secular folk, laity,⁴ male and female, do sit in the frater and infirmary,
spending their time in eating and drinking, to the large disbursement and
serious cost of the house.

(Against the prior.) Brother William Watforde‚ the sub-prior, says
that the prior is of no account in matters temporal ε therefore all things

. are like to go to naught, albeit he has some degree of experience in the

craft of the stone-mason and carpenter.

(Against the prior.) Also he says [that], during the last voidance
[of the priory], to wit, Henry Brewies,⁵ Fysshere, Thomas Hald',⁶ clerk,
Newenham, who is now with the earl of Huntingdon as auditor,⁷ Nicholas

· Weste of Daventry and several others of Daventry, friends of the prior

 

that now is, bound themselves to William Tresham and Richard Knyght-
ley⁸ in considerable sums of money to pay the debts of the house, which
was at that time oppressed with debt in manifold wise, on the mutual
condition that the present prior, who was then a monk of the monastery
of Peterborough‚⁹ should be elected as prior, for the provision and elec-
tion of whom Thomas Newenham was importunate ; and the said bond
was delivered to the convent by the same who were bound before the
holding of the same electiori of the same who is now prior. Being sworn
to tell the truth, he denies the knowledge thereos before his election ι he
contesses, however, that he heard such reports after his confirmation,
and believes them to be true ; and this his fellow-monks related to him.

He confesses also that delivery of that bond was made with his consent
to those who were bound.1⁰

(Against the prior.) 'Also throughout the whole tirne of his presi·
dency the prior has only once rendered an account of his administration.
(Against the prior.) Also the same who is now prior, before he
agreed to such election made of himself, took an oath at Peterborough‚

θ Possibly Haldenby (Holmby).

⁷ The earl of Huntingdon was John Holand, second son of John Holand, duke of
Exeter and earl of Huntingdon, the half-brother of Richard 11. He was born in 1395, and,
after his distinguished conduct at Agincourt‚ was restored to his father's earldom in 1416.
He achieved much distinction in France‚ was made governor of Aquitaine in 1440, and
restored to the dukedom of Exeter in 1443, the year succeeding this visitation. He died in
ἔῃ.. Tdhe advowson of Daventry priory belonged to him as appendant to the honour of

untin on.

⁸ vililliam Tresham of Rushton, knight of the shire for N orthamptonshire 1423-50, and
speaker of the House of Commons, was the founder of the celebrated N orthamptonshire
family of that name. He was murdered in 1450. Richard Knightley of Gnosall, Staffs„
lord of the manors of Burgh hall and Cowley, purchased the manor of Fawsley, near
Daventry, in 1416. He was knight of the shire for Northamptonshire and died in 1443.

⁹ Daventry‚ though a Cluniae foundation, had become merged in the English Benedic-
tine order, like other Cluniae priories, after the suppression of alien priories in England.
As this passage shews, its prior came from a great Benedictine house.

¹⁰ The point involved was, of course, the guilt of simony on the part of the prior.
From the sequel it appears that he incurred the sentence of deprivation, but that the bishop
took a lenient view of his conduct and merely released him from the control of the temp·
oralities of the priory.
