LEICESTER, NEW COLLEGE, 1440 189

the dean. He denies the second article and denies the third from the
time of his correction made by the dean ; of the which charges he cleared
himself on his unsupported 03111, 3061 was warned to have no familiar inter-
course, etc., under the penalties of excommunication and deprivation.

(The provost : penalty.) Also the provost does not render his
accounts twice in the year according to the statutes¹ ε 161 30 injunction
be made touching this. He confesses that he has not accounted accord-
ing to the statutes. (InJunction.)

(The provost 2 penalty.) Also the provost, when he will go outside
the college on the house's business, does not make known to the dean or
his lieutenant that he will be away; the which he cannot do, since he
himself 1s the dean’ 3 lieutenant m [the dean' s] absence. (Injunction 10.)

(Deyz note.) Master John Dey does not duly repair his abode as
canon, inasmuch as it well· nigh threatens decay beyond repair3 for he
devours all his goods, ever giving the rein to gluttony (Injunction 11th. )

(Narborough.) Master John Atkynsone, rector of Ν3113010οἓ11,2
who boards with a canon of the college, admits suspect women in manner
suspect 10 1113 chantry⁸ within the college, and especially the wife of one
Broghtone. (Injunction 12.)

Sir William Bedale‚ canon and prebendary of the second prebend,⁴
exhibited 1116 1611613 of his title in his prebend: he exhibited also his
letters of orders, which are suspect because they are scratched out as
regards the name and surname. Therefore he has a term on this side
the feast of Easter next for making sufficient exhibition in respect of his
orders, wheresoever my lord shall be within the diocese. (Note.) And
he says that sir John Shiryngham is suspect with Rygmaydene's wife,
but he has cleared himself in the presence of Fysshewyk,5 the dean's
1160160301.

Α130 116 says that the forty pounds which were left by Swalwelle⁶
and the fifty marks left by sir John Charytee,⁷ 6300113, for the relief of
the payments that should be made by the provost, on condition that they
should be paid back at the 6061 of the year, were delivered to sir John
Whyte³ then the provost, who paid them in the business affairs of the
church and died before the end of the year; and so the church 1s in debt
as regards these sums. (Swalwelle' s and Ch,aryoee‚ 3 1000163. Injunction. )

 

which he res. before 2 Nov.‚,1440 when he was followed by Henry Rose (see note ο 00
p Ι868Ιξιοῂ11οῐ118ὲνν31111611 was admitted to the eighth prebend, at the pres. of the Crown,
21 Oct, 1418 (Reg. xlv, fo. 198). He died before 13 June, 1434 (Reg. XVII. fo. 42).

7 John Charyte was admitted to the second prebend, at the pres. of the Crown, 22 May,
1404 (Reg. X111, fo. 83d.). This pres. and inst. appear to have been made 10 error, as the
stall was not void, and Charyte was admitted to the ninth prebend, 2 June, 1404 phul..) It
13 not recorded when he vacated it, possibly 10 1434 (see next note).

Β ]0110 Whyte was admitted to ‘the fourth prebend, at the pres. of the Crown, 19 April,
1421 (Reg. XV1‚ fo. 90). The year in which he died' 1s not certain; but the wording of the
present deposition, compared with that of the injunction upon this point, indicates that
Charyte died 1n the same year as Swalwell, viz„ 1434, and that Whyte died within a year of
them. After his death, the money seems to have been spent. Welles (see note 5 00 p. 188
above) was probably his immediate successor in the fourth stall. In 1424 Whyte joined with
Thomas Halywell, his fenow- -,canon and one John Hornyngwold, in making certain endow-
ments over to the college, including lands and rent granted apparently in augmentation· of
the revenue of the double chantry which had been founded by John of Gaunt’s executors
(Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports and Papers XXXII, 530).
