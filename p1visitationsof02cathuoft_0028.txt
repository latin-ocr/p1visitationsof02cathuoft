One Clement Denston also, the same bishop's archdeaeon,1 and 0116
Ν16110135 Bakhot raised a mighty wind against ‘the exemption and
privileges ; but the monastery of St. Edmund, founded upon a strong
rock, stood as a mountain that may not be moved, and confusion covered
their faces. And, even as Berith and Asteroth fied from the face of
blessed Bartholomew the apostle, so these wicked folk fled when no man
pursued. Thereafter by God's will they were taken and fell by their
deserts into the pit which they had 1113616.’2 111 view of Alnwick’s alleged
connexion with the Benedictine order as a monk of one of the greatest
exempt houses in England and as prior of one of its cells in the diocese,
it may be remarked that it is strange that the monk of Bury makes no
point of the apostasy from loyalty to his order which the bishop's action
implies ; and his silence adds to the weight of proof against the confu-
sion of the bishop with ,1116 Β6116611611116. Further, in the register of
30001 Whethamstede of St. Albans, there is a long and detailed account
of the dispute which arose 0111 of the refusal of the prior of Binham,
a cell of St. Albans, -to welcome Alnwick as he passed through the
diocese of Norwich on visitation in 1431-2. Alnwick retaliated by
appointing the prior, although a member of 311 exempt house, collector
of the tenth in the diocese. Whethamstede took up the prior's cause,
and signalised the triumphant issue in 1433 by writing a series of Latin
hexameters satirising Alnwick and his friend, the treasurer Cromwell,
with far-fetched puns on their names, and praising John Juyn, chief
baron of the exchequer, with equally recondite 1118611111157.3 Had Alnwick
been previously a member of the monastery with whose privileges he
thus found himself at war, it is incredible that the annalist of the dispute
should have failed to make the most of the fact.

The present series of visitation records affords abundant proof that
Alnwick was painstaking and 11101011811111 his work. In the diocese of
Lincoln he had to compete with no independent republics such as that
of Bury St. Edmunds3 the jurisdiction of St. Α103115,31111011811 nominally
within the diocese, lay upon its southern frontier and practically consti-
tuted a small diocese with which 116 11361 only nominal concern ; while
the jurisdiction of Dorchester lay more or less within his control as per-
petual founder and patron of the abbey. At Leicester, where he found

with the monasteries of Lincoln diocese there is no trace. While,
like most other prelates who were confronted with the problem, he
evldently disliked the existence of ecclesiastical republics, whether
regular or secular, in his diocese, his desire was 10 increase, and not
