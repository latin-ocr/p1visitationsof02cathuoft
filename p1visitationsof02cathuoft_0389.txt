 

IRTHLiNcssoRoUGH COLLEGE, 1442 158

Also, seeing that the same dean is broken in health by reason of old
age and cannot undergo the burthens that lie upon him, he therefore
prays that in his relies the other canons who are strong may visit the sick
of the parish‚l and that the hebdomadary² may occupy the pulpit on
Sundays, saying the common suffrages and fulfilling the other duties to
be performed in the same.³

Also he says that the profits of the house have grown so much less
that either they must be increased or the number [of canons] be
diminished ; and he prays that the use of almuces and copes of grey sur-⁴
be utterly left off, save on the chief festivals, since such use cannot be
maintained by them.

Also he says that sir Richard Smythe, canon, is past bearing among
his fellows, rebuking and lying about them, and, though warned [often-
times], he ceases not. He was admonished to cease under pain of the
loss of a penny for every default.

Also Walter Luffenham, being absent, not upon the business of the
church, trom the canonical hours, and being fined therefore, [will] not

‘pay his fines [according to] the statute.⁵

[Also] he says that sir John Haryotes, sometime canon and purveyor
of the house,‘⁵ went away with an acquittance at the close of his account
and left two heaps of peas, which sir Walter sold when he entered upon
his office ; and yet he says that the college is in his debt. He delivered
to my lord an account whereby this will be plain.

Also he says that sometimes the same Walter, without reason and
not constrained by necessity, spends the night outside the college,
[which] also [is] contrary to the statutes. He denies the article : he was
ordered to make purgation with two of his fellows, and cleared himself
with Smythe and Burtone. ,

Sir Walter Luffenham, the sub—dean, says that the dean is backward
and careless in claiming the rights of the college and tithes of willows
and ashes,'¹ and in recovering a garden whereof the college was seised by
the founder for eight years,8 and now dame Elizabeth Braunspathe⁹

 

⁷ The characteristic trees of the neighbourhood. The willows grow beside the Neue,
while the ash is the most common tree throughout this part of Northamptonshire.

⁸ I.e., the college was seised of it by the founder and held it for eight years, after which
it had been appropriated by the tenant.

⁹ Elizabeth Braunspath appears to have been the relict of sir William Braunspath, kt.‚
sheriffof Northamptonshire (before knighthood) 1430-1‚ and M.P. for the county in 1427 and
1436-7 (Nortlzamptonshire Families, pp. 370, 375). She was apparently the daughter and
heiress of N icholas Pyel, son of the founder of the college, and seems to have been previously
married to sir William Hodelston‚ kt.‚ M .P. for N orthamptonshire (before knighthood), 1411
and 1415-6 (ibim, p. 375l‚ to whom she brought her estates in Irthlingborough and neigh-
bouring parishes. Hodelston presented four times to canonries and prebends in the collegiate
church in 1410, 1415 and 1417 (Reg. xiv, ff 243d, 244, 261, 269). According to the in-
scription formerly on his tomb at Irthlingborough, he was bailiff of Alenqon (‘Alanston’) and
died at Argentan (‘Argentyn'), 13 Aug.. 1422 (fflidges, Hcht. Northants. 11, 238). William
Braunspath‚ whom she appears to have married about a year later, presented seven times to
canonries and prebends in 1423-4‚ 1428, 1429, 1431, 1434, 1435 and 1437 (Reg. XVI,
ff. 70, 75d, 80d3 xvii, ff. 22, 42, 35 ; xvnr, so. 115d). His death must have
occurred before 1442-3, when his widow, under the name of Elizabeth Hodleston,
presented to the mediety of W oodford church‚ Northants , which was part of
the Pyel inheritance (Bridges, op. cit., 11, 268.) In 1445 she presented to the same
mediety under the name of Elizabeth Branspath (ibid.)‚ but in 1447, when she presented
to a canonry and prebend in Irthlingborough, she is again called Elizabeth Hodleston
(Reg. XVIII, fo. 138). When she died in 1448, she was buried with her first husband in
the collegiate church (Bridges, op. cit„ 11, 238). The inscription, which may have belonged
