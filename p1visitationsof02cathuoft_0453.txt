LEICESTER, NEW COLLEGE, 1440 190

(Bramburghe.) Sir John Bramburghe‚¹ canon, is defamed with
Cicely Trebys, married woman, and Agnes the wife of William Cap-
makere. He appeared on the second day of December and denies the
first at any time and the second at any time : he denies also the third,
fourth and fifth² at any time. Wherefore my lord bade him clear him-
self with three of his brethren, and so he cleared himself with CheIle,
Shiryngham and Bedale ; and he was warned under pain of excommuni-
cation and forty shillings to the fabric fund of the church to have no
familiar intercourse [with them].

(The same ε note.) The same, whenever he says his service in quire,
says it by himself in so loud and clear a voice that he hinders the others
who are round about him in singing the psalms He confesses, and was
warned to make amends under pain of paying fourpence to the fabric
fund of the church and sixpence to the poor folk in the almonry every
time wherein he shall transgress in this respect. (Injunction 3.)

, (All.) Also the canons do not rise for matins according to the
statutes, for according to the statutes there should always be four
present⁸; and they say ‘I know how much I shall lose: I had rather
lose it than get up ⁷ ; insomuch that sometimes there is only one canon
present at matins, [and thereby] they incur perjury. (injunction 14th.)

(The dean.) Also they that are absent from quire are not punished
as-the statutes demand, nor is the penalty levied: therefore they fear
not to be absent. (Injunction 2.)

(Let an injunction be made.) Also he says [that] the offices of the
provost and the dean's lieutenant in his absence are held by one and the
same erson.

(lSIatfene : note.) Sir Robert Matfene,4 a canon having a prebend,
holds the hospital of St. Leonard,⁵ the master whereof‚ as a man of

Δ religion, did wear aforetime a black habit with a red crescent and star

in the midst thereof.⁶ He confesses that he holds such hospital : but he
avers that it is compatible with his canonry and prebend or with any
other benefice with cure whatsoever.⁷

(Symeon's chantry. Injunction.) Also the three chantries founded
for the soul of Simon Symeon⁸ are served by the vicars of the church,

 

⁵ The leper-hospital of St. Leonard outside the north gate of Leiceester was founded
late in the twelfth century by William the leper, third son of Robert ‘ Blanchesmains,’ third
earl of Leicester, and his wife Pernell (Knighton‚ ed. Lumby [Rolls ser.] 1, 64). In 1477-8‚
William, lord Hastings, to whom the hospital had been granted by Edward IV, gave it and
St. John's hospital to the dean and canons of the New college (Assae. Archit. Soc. Reports
and Papers XXXII, 550: see also Nichols‚ Hist. Leicesterslzire I, 333).

⁸ Cf. the red cross on the habit of the master and brethren of St. Leonard’s hospital,
Bedford(Visitati0ns ι, 8). The warden and chaplains of the Newarke hospital, by the
original foundation of 1330-1, had as their badge a white crescent moon and star on their
habit (Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports and Papers XXXII, 249).

7 Masterships of hospitals, as a general rule, were regarded as compatible benefices with
no cure of souls attached. See, e.g., the case of Brackley hospital ( Visitations 1, 14). Numerous
examples will be found in Cal. Papal Letters and in the plurality certificates (1366) in
Lambeth Reg. Langham : e.g., the hospital of St. Mary Magdalene by Berwick-on-Tweed,
beneficium non curatum (Reg. Langham, fo. 4d.>, and that of St. John the Baptist at Lynn,
similarly described (ibid., ff, 4d, 5). Matfen’s cure of souls was North Luffenham : his
canonry and prebend were, like his hospital, compatible benefices without cure.

⁸ The career of Simon Symeon, a faithful servant of Henry, earl of Lancaster, founder
of the hospital, of his son duke Henry, founder of the college, and of the duke’s son-in-law,
John of Gaunt, is sketched in Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports ami Papers XXXII, 518-20. For
details of his grant (1381-2) of the manor and advowson of Cransley‚ Northams., to the
college for the maintenance of three chantries at the altar constructed by him on the north
side of the collegiate church, see ibid„ 520-1.
