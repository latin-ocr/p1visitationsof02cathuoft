roam in the nave of the church in time of divine service, contrary to the

(Shiryngham and Bramburghe: note.) Also that Alice Wodehille
has common recourse to the lodgings of Shiryngham and Bramburghe in
manner suspect, and there she bakes their bread. Shiryngham appeared
on the second day of December and, the article having been laid to his

him clear himself with three of his brethren in respect of this same
woman at once, and so he cleared himself with Chelle and Bramburghe.

great annoyance to them that sing the psalms in quire, in the matter of
