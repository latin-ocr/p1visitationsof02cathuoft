xxxiv INTRODUCTION

Sleaford occurs on 28, Nettleham and Liddington on 22, which is
im vossible.1

} July, August, 1439. Documents from Sleaford 4, 6, 14, 17 July, and
7, 9 August. But on 10 and 11 July the dates are Brentford and
London. The bishop probably went to London before 10 July and did
not leave London till the end of August. The Sleaford dates therefore
are not personal.

September, 1439. 2, Wooburn; 6-27, Buckden (with a colliding
date, 24, Sleaford) ; 28, visitation of St. Neots priory.

October, 1439. 5-14, Buckden ς 15, visitation of Huntingdon
priory ; 16-31, Buckden.

November, December, 1439. 9 Nov., Buckden; 14 Nov.-14 Deo,
London, with colliding dates from Buckden 3 19-22 Dec„ Buckden ; 23
Dec.. Liddington. *¹

Christmas of 1439 was apparently spent at Liddington. The period
1439-40, star-ting with Liddington, 1-3 January, is very perplexing. On
17 January there comes a doubtful date from Nettleham. On 3 and 4
February Lincoln cathedral and Nettleham are probably genuine; but
this Candlemas visit is thrust in between one visit to Reading (23-29
January) and a second (6-8 February). If this is so, Alnwick must have
travelled quickly, as on 6 February Northampton appears as well as
Reading. On 14 February, there is a date from Liddington: on the
20111, Alnwick was at Lincoln, and from 22 February to 22 March he was
at Nettleham, paying his third visit to Bardney on 17 March. Two dates
at the end of February, from Liddington, do not seem to belong to the
personal series.

Lady day, 1440, found Alnwick at Windsor. The next dates are 31
March, Tattershall 3 1 April, Nettleham 3 3 April, Cambridge. Alnwick’s
business at Cambridge, if there is no mistake in the year,2 was soon dis-
patched, and three days later (6 April) he began a visitation of the arch-
deaconry of Stow. This is his first systematic visitation which can be
traced of any archdeaconry in his diocese, although there are indica-
tions, as has been noted, of a visitation of a portion at any rate of the
archdeaconry of Lincoln in 1438. The dates are :

6 April, Torksey and Fosse priories ; 7, Heynings priory; 8,
‘Benyng' (an error for ‘Henyng,' i.e. Heynings): 9, Nettleham; 11,
Gokewell priory ; 12, T hornholm priory (one entry gives Thornton, and
obvious error) 3 16, Spital-in-the-Street, Nettleham.

The bishop left Lincoln about 18 April, and journeyed by Lidding-
ton (21 April) and Buckden (25 April) to London, where, in spite of a
colliding date from Sleaford, he must have arrived on the 26th. The
last date from London is 4 May, but there is a premature date from

Buckden the day before. The occurrence of Bedford, however, on ‚

13 May seems to shew that Alnwick did not leave London on his way to
Sleaford (20-31 May) till some time after the 4th.
From Sleaford, after 13 June, he made a thorough visitation of

 

1 The long injunctions for Ramsey are dated from Nettleham‚ 13 June, 1439. The
Klilsitation is undated, but it may have been made while Alnwick was at Buckden in April or
ay.

ῗξῗαῑ t'nis date, however, refers to 1441, is more than probable. See note 2 on p.
