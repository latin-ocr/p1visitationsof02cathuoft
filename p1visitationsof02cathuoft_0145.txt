BICESTER PRIORY, 1445 35

Brother John Burcestre, the sub-prior, says that two silver basons
and other jewels1 of the house are in pawn to a certain man . . . . in
London for ten pounds, nor have they a bond for their restoration when
payment has been made; and these things are [done] by the will of

the whole convent.
Also he says that silence is not well kept in the due places according

to the rule. On the 29th day of the month of 'May in the year abovesaid2
my lord warned the prior a first, second and third time peremptorily‚
under pain of the greater excommunication‚ which he intends to pro-
nounce against him if he obeys not these admonitions‚ to cause silence
to be kept in all places according to the rule.

Also he says that the sons of two gentIemen, to wit Lawis and
Purcelle,³ are nurtured and instructed in the house : whether at its [the
house’s] or their parents’ cost is unknown. The prior was enjoined not
to maintain the sons of noblemen or powerful folk at the costs of the
house.

Also he says that canons are not supplied with the money for their
raiment, which ought to have been paid at the last feast of the Annunci-
ation. The prior was enj0ined to give satisfaction to the canons touching
their raiment at the accustomed terms.

Brother William Chestertone says that all is well.

Brother Robert Lawntone says that=tsilence is not kept in the
requisite places according to the rule.

Brother Richard Hynbest says that the vicar and schoolmaster, who
board in that place, eat together with the canons in the frater.⁴

Brother John Smyth says that whenever the canons who abide in
cloister from day to day ask licence of the sub-prior5 to take recreation
he answers [that he] has [not] the power [to give it]‚ nay, the same
power abides in the priorG ; and thus they are put to the utmost weari-
ness. ’ξᾚε prior was enjoined to see that the canons have reasonable
se mes,

y Also he says as above touching the raiment‚ for payment which
should be made at Easter is sometimes put off till Michaelmas.

Brother William Bathe agrees with the aforesaid Smythe in his
depolsklltslgrhse says that of late there were pawned in London without [the
consent] of the convent one [silver] gilt cup for the Body of Christ,8

in the schedule printed below.

⁸ Cf. the ‘Cuppe ad Corpus Domini ' among the treasures of the cathedral priory of
Canterbury in 1315-6. The pyx or box or casket in which the Blessed Sacrament was
reserved was placed in the cup: thus one of these vessels at Canterbury is described as
⁴ Item Cuppa .j . aurea cum lapide onichino . cum pixide aurea in fundo . cum .j . Camau '
(Legg and Hope, Inventories of Clz. Ch. Cant.‚ p. 73). See also Wordsworth‚ Salisbury
Processions and Ceremonies, p. 178, ior ‘ Cuppa vna argent’ bene deaurata ..... in qua
reponitur eukaristia’, which belonged to the cathedral church of Salisbury in the 13th
century. Among the vessels which in 1270 were wanting to the church of Westbury-on—
Trym, Glouces.‚ was an ivory pyx or silver cup to hang over the altar under lock‚ to hold
the Eucharist (worces. Reg. Giffard, f. 32).
