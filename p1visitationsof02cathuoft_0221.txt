DORCHESTER ABEEY, 1441 73

Walter Dorchestre did keep a woman, by name Joan Barbour, and
:2- gat her with child, insomuch that her husband would have slain him,
ssss'a and so at last [the husband], being brought to an agreement, had a
’ᾗ pension from him that he might do nothing more against him. He did
j keep also the wife of Thomas Dey our serving—man and gat her with
J child, as is commonly voiced and· reported of all. He did also pawn a
, silver and a silver-gilt chalice of the infirmary, what time he was warden
’ ’; of the office of the same ι he did lose or sell five spoons belonging to the
, same office. He had also a bird, in English a goshawk, which he did
j keep long time and on account of which he did cause the house to lose
fifty shillings. He slept also for a month in the infirmary without special
³' v leave of the abbot night after night, and did have women and unhonest
{zompany with him, wherefore the house was utterly given over to ill
ame.
Nicholas Plymmothe was taken by your tenants1 with the wite of
our tanner [etc.].
,ρ John Scherousbery is of very evil report, because he was caught in
the bell-tower with a woman, whom, being led thereto by fear and {right,
5. he put into a chest of the house.
The abbot is of most unclean lit‘e. He is not diligent in quire either
² by day or night: he makes no corrections of the transgressions of the
53 canons He keeps several women whose names I know not, but these Ι
’ do know ε Joan Baroun, with whom he was taken in the steward's
' chamber ; he keeps John Forde's wife3 he keeps John Roche’s wife ;
he keeps John Prest's wife ; he keeps Thomas Fisher’s wife ; and
all these he pays by means of the goods of the house and squanders the
goods of the house upon them, doing no good and naught but waste².
*All its jewels are in pawn or utterly sold, but this William Marmyone,
his steward, did grant him so much on loan that he was able to have
them against your coming, but not all, even as the writing made thereos
clearly declares. The house plainly owes on a clear reckoning more than
two hundred pounds, as is noised among us 3 and, had it been able
to escape this your visitation, doubtless it would ere long be without
enough for the maintenance of four canons, Wherefore let us now feel

On and in the aforesaid day and place John Brewere‚ household
servant in the monastery of Dorchester‚ did complain to my lord on
behalf of the convent of the same monastery that one John Frankeleyne‚
keeper of the warren of the monastery in the same place under William
Marmyone. the farmer of the same warren under the common seal of the
house for the term of his life, does make many sundry assaults upon the
canons of the said monastery and lays violent hands upon them, to
