FoRMED IN THE CHAPEL OF BLESSED MARY IN THE SAME PLACE
m L1Eu oF A PLACE OF CHAPTER, on THE 26TH DAY OF THE
MONTH OFJUNE,1N THE YEAR OF ουκ LoRD 1442, ΒΥ THE
REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM,
BY'THE GRACE OF Gon BISHOP OF LINCOLN, 1N THE SIXTEENTH
YEAR OF His CONSECRATION AND THE SIXTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his capacity
of judge as a tribunal on and in'the said day, place and year, in the beginn-
ing and continuation of the business of such his visitation, there appeared
before him the master and the perpetual fellows and the other ministers

and servants of the said college, in readiness, as was apparent, to undergo
the said visitation. And then first and before all else the word of God
was set forth in accordance with the process about to take place by the
honourable master John Beverley‚ eminent as a doctor of divinity, aster
this text, ‘ Be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.’ And when
this was finished in a highly polished manner in the Latin tongue, and
those who had no concern in being present went away from the place, sir
Richard Vautort, master of the said college, reverently delivered to the
said reverend father the certificate of my lord's mandate which had been
addressed to him for such business drawn up in form 3 the which having
been read in the public hearing in these words, ‘To the reverend father
in Christ ', etc.‚ and after the fellows, ministers and servants of the college
who had been summoned had been called over and appeared, sir william
Thurleby and masters John White and Richard Laxtone, perpetual fellows,
and William Wolstone and Thomas Sirefe, priests who are within [their
term] of probation in the same college, sware canonical obedience and
exhibited the letters of their orders.

Sir Richard Vautort, master of the college, says that according to the
original charter of erectiori and *the statutes of the college also there
should be in the college twelve chaplain fellows and a master ; and now
there are only twelve in all.1 Likewise there should be four gentlemen
clerks and four yeomen clerks, and now there are but six. Also there
should be thirteen choristers‚ and now there are but ten ; and interro-
gated concerning the reason of the decline of numbers, he says that the
rents and goods of the college have grown to so little that they are hardly
or are not sufficient for the maintenance for the number that now is.

(Puttenham ε White.) Also he says that so greatly does John Putt-
enham undermine the hearts of the fellows and has so allured them to him,
that without distinction they go outside the college precincts without leave
of the master and against his forbidding, and do publicly use the public
taverns ; and women also have often access to the chambers of the sellom,
oi John Whyte to wit.

(White.) Also a certain woman, the same John Whyte’s mother-'s
servant, has often and suspect access to the same John’s chamber, under
pretext of waking of a night2 the boys whom he has sleeping with him

² Le. for matins.
