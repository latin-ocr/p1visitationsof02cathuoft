number of whom amounts generally to sixteen, and then there are not
more than two or three who stand in quire in their habit.

(The abbot‚) Also he says that there is a great crowd of useless
hounds in the monastery, by whom it is feared that the alms οἱ their tables
are consumed.

(The abbot.) Also he says that the abbot is very neglectful in
making search after owners of private property, for he says that the
abundance of money is the cause of many evils (10th.)

Also he says that no-one is kept to teach the novices and younger
canons in grammar. -

Also he says that there are two persons who are maintained out of
the common goods of the house by the abbot‚ one a clerk and the other
a layman, but he knows not how or when they came into the monastery.

Brother Thomas Belgrave says that there are now only six boys,¹
while once there were sixteen or fourteen.

(The abbot.) Also he says that no teacher in grammar is kept either
in the monastery or in the town oi Leicester‚ whereas the abbot is bound
to furnish such a teacher, to wit in the town, for the instruction both of
the clerks of the almonry and of the others of the country round. (15th.)

(The abbot‚) Also he says that the canons who have their meat in
the abbot's hall sit without distinction with secular folk.

(The abbot.) Also he says that brother William Coventre, who was
sometime of loose character and given to breaches of discipline, is now
appointed warden of the guest-house, wherein he is able to have free rein
for doing [what] and going whither he will.

(The abbot‚) Brother John Whytley says [as above] concerning
the scarcity of the canons and also concerning the number of the boys in
the almonry, whereas there were wont to be twenty-six, and yet they
who now are are not duly and fittingly nurtured in the abbot's default.

Also it is said that once or twice the abbot has taken monies from
[boys] to be admitted into the almonry, and they who are received are
incapable and unfit, and yet are not instructed in the elementary parts of
knowledge, but do service to the canons, being sent on their businesses
as though they were hirelings ; to wit, twenty shillings from Roger
Bgulhdtra’s nephewss and another time in the like case, six shillings and
eig pence. ( t .

(The abbot9.) ›Also there are no canons in priest’s orders, who could
bear the burthens incumbent on them, if any one of them should be in
go fit case to celebrate, insomuch that sometimes such burthens are not

attend upon them, give their time by themselves privily to an art which
{iscalled multiplying,² whereby he fears that the house suffers grievous

amage.

(11. The abbot‚) Also he says that the abbot does not change his
chaplains according to the constitutions, but sometimes keeps thern for
