or molest them in the execution of my will, seeing that there exists
no other cause, a hundred pounds; albeit I received from my
predecessor by the hands of his executors, only in the first place a
hundred marks, and at another time a hundred shillings and a
pontifical valued at twenty marks and three small cruets¹ for oil and
chrism to the value of forty shillings‚ even as sir William Booth,
canon of London‚² and the aforesaid executors who still survive are

sums of money in their repair and in the construction of new
buildings from money procured far beyond the sum for which the
rents and revenues of my church of Lincoln‚ after the victuals and
raiment of me and mine had been deducted from the same, could
be sufficient, as may clearly appear to anyone who will look into it
by my yearly accounts. But if my aforesaid successor will not be
able to be so contented, but is bent on encroaching on my goods
through right or wrong, I will that my executorS, before they in
