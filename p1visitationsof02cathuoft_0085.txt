ANKERWYKE PRIORY, 1441 5

(See 18.) Sister Thomasine Talbot saith that the prioress does not
provide this deponent with bed-clotheS, insomuch that she lies in the
straw; and when my lord had commanded this deponent to lie in the
dorter,l and this deponent asked bed-clothes of the prioress, she said
chidingly to her, ‘ Let him who gave you leave to lie in the dorter supply
you with raiment '.

(See 22.) Also when the nuns' friends come down to the priory to
see the nuns, the prioress bears herself crossly in giving leave to the
nuns to talk with their friends.

(See 14.) Also the prioress has on her neck a long silken band, in
English a lace, which hangs *down below her breast, and thereon a
golden ring with one diamond 3 and she has all the archives and the
common seal of the house in her keeping. She confesses her wearing of
such lace and ring, but in jest.

26. Also many times, when the prioress comes to quire at the end
of the canonical hours, she makes the nuns begin those hours over again.

(See 18.) This deponent has no kirtle appointed for her use.

Sister Agnes Dychere asks that sufficient provision be made to her
in clothing for her bed and body, that she may be covered from the
cold, and also in eatables, that she may have strength to undergo the

· burden of religious observance and divine service, for these hitherto had

not been so supplied to her.

She and the other young nuns have not a governess in reading,
song, or religious observance.

Also she says that the prioress causes the nuns to exeeed in singing
„ more psalms than is the manner accustomed in the place.

Sister Margaret Smythe speaks of the failure to repair, of xthe
charters and common seal of the house, etc.

h Also she says that the prioress is very harsh and is too excessive in
er corrections.

d Alsotthe prioress makes not sufficient supply οἱ bed-clothes to this
eponen .

b Also she asks for a governess in reading, song, and religious
o servance.

And, having examined these, passing by other three, to wit sisters
Isabel Coke, Elizabeth Londone and Ellen Moretone, on account of their
tender age and slender discretion‚ seeing that the eldest of them is not
more than thirteen years of age, my lord adjourned such his visitation and
the business thereos even as it then stood until and unto Monday next be-
fore the feast of All SaintS, to wit after the feast of the apostles Simon and
Jude next to come,2 and in so appointing he appointed the same Monday
for the said prioress and nuns in the same chapter-house in presence of
him or his commissary, to proceed and watch further process in the
business of such visitation according to the merits of such his preparatory

ation must have taken place in 1442. There can be little doubt, however, from the heading,
that it took place in 1441, and that 29 October is therefore wrong.
