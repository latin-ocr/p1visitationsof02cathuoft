¹ The reference is to archbishop Langton¹s constitution Ad haec. ‘Decernimus ut
moniales et cetere mulieres divino cultui dedicate velum vel peplum sericum non habeant,
nec in velo acus argenteas vel aureas audeant deportare. Nec ipse, nec monachi nec
canonici regulares habeant zonas sericas vel auri vel argenti ornatum habentes. nec burneto
vel alio panno irregulari decetero utantur. Metiantur eciam juxta dimensionem corporum
vestes suas, ita quod longitudinem corporum non excedant, sed pede sicut decet supertecto
sufficiat eis cum Joseph veste indui talari. Et sola monialis consecrata deferat annulum,
et uno solo sit contenta.'

2 This and the following notes are memoranda for the injunctions drawn up from the
detecta, as in the case of Gracedieu. p. 121 above.

³ Le. the commissary-general in the archdeaconry of Leicester. No special injunction
could be made on this head: the case was special and lady Audley was not a nun. Her
case, however, in its general bearing is covered by the injunction about boarders.
