in his chamber without leave of the master. He [Whyte] believes the
. woman to have access, but does not confess it.

(Thurleby) Also sir William Thurleby is brought in suspicion of
adultery with the wife of Thomas Page of the same, who has often access
to the chamber of the same sir William. Also he is held in suspicion with

Agnes Tapstere, the drawer² at the Tabard at Stamford.

(Thurleby.) The same haunts the public taverns in the town against
the master's forbidding and the purport of the statutes.²

(White.) Also master John White does not attend quire as the
statutes bind him to do,⁸ and whenever he comes to quire, he stays for the
third lesson at matins, and then goes out of quire and runs abroad to
things forbidden.

(Puttenham.) Also sir John Puttenham, disobeying the master as

presence at, the canoriical hours affici mass, 1' win' go out whitffersoevg
and as often soever as in what place l will, without asking any leave of
you in this behalf.’

(Palmere.) Also sir John Palmere brews mead, and on this account
has sometimes four, five or six women with him in his chamber,
sometimes one alone, wherefrom there arises suspicion.

(Puttenham.) Also sir John Puttenham has continued steward of the
guest-house for a year : he refuses to render an account of that office in
public, after being asked by the master time and again. He confesses that
he has not made reckoning‚ and alleges the reason as on the left side of
the righttigissiiam.) Also the same sir John, although he has no authority,

” ’ privilege or commission, preached in public with a text in the vulgar

tongue in the church there one Sunday‚ to' wit on the twelfth day of
March last past, by reason whereof the place has been put under interdict‚
and he himself incurred the sentence of excommunication‚ and so did
celebrate on the same day and several days since and does celebrate,
incurring irregularity. He confesses to have preached : he alleges a
licence, whereof he shews no proof. He has the morrow in the same
place to shew cause why he ought not to be declared irregular and to be
deprived of his benefice in the college.

(All and Puttenham.) Also he says that all of the college are in
league with Puttenham to so great an extent that, whatever he says, they
all agree with him,‘5 and in special against the master.

(Thurleby.) Sir John Brownyng, the precentor, says that Thurleby
very often after he has entered quire goes out of quire before divine ser-
vice is ended and without reason. He confesses it : he has the morrow
in this place for receiving penance.

(The master.) Also he says that in the master's default the fellows
of the college and he himself are not provided with their stipenda and
he says that the possessions and rents of the college are in these days as
pkfftfflss and profitable as they were at the time of the foundation of the
co ege.
