BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-ss 15

Also he says that there is sore division and discord among almost all
of the convent, who are confederate together and in conspiracy one with
another against brother Thomas Bartone.

(York.) Also he says that brother William York challenged a
serving-man of the abbot to fight, saying ‘ Come outside the gate ', and
at length [came] to the abbot, reproaching him for having incited his
serving-man to thrash him 3 and that when the abbot told him to go to
...... he would not obey such an one who should supply his place.

Also he says that the baker, the brewer, the porter, the smith and
the lime-burner receive corrodies severally of a large amount [and] do

’ eat almost daily of the abbot’s victuals.

Also he says that they who abide in the frater have each his separate
“ dish and they in the infirmary do eat by two and twog· and every day in

the frater they will have at least three sorts of fish.

Also he says that women have .too free and often access to the
cloister precincts and most especially to the infirmary, [where there is]
eating, drinking and chattering between the monks and the same women

to the great expense and scandal [of the monastery].

Also he says that in the conventual church the monks almost of
’ custom do chatter with women during divine service [in a very . . . .]
ψ manner, by reason whereof the monastery is very evil spoken of.
⁷ Also he says that each monk receives for his clothing year by year

forty shillings in divers parcels.

Brother William Burghe, the sub-prior, being examined says that
sometimeS, when fish cannot be got, no-one keeps frater.1
N '([Against] the novices). Also he says that brothers John’ Howtone,
John Sallowe and William Bekeryng have been professed for seven years
and have not yet completed their profession and will not do so,“³ and yet
do aspire to the priesthood. Rose was restored to every act of chapter,
also to his voice and vote in chapter and to his former liberty. [My
lord] ordained that in frater and elsewhere [the others] shall be satisfied
with one sort of fish and one sort of flesh until they have made full
profession.

Brother John Bracy says that the monastery is able to spend 500
marks, and says that it is 300 marks in debt to divers creditors.

He also prays, since some provisions of money have been made by
loan for the payment of debts and other advantages of the house, that
such monies be put under safeguard in one certain place that they may
be applied to the profit of the monastery, and that henceforward they be
not put, as is the custom, in the hand of a single person, when they were
quickly wasted. Let it be done henceforward as is requested.

Also he says that the conventual church is very dilapidated and the
quire is almost ready to fall, and this because of default in repair. He

² A religious who had worn the habit for a whole year after entering a monastery was
regarded as tacite professus. So Martem, De Antiquis Monachorum Ritibus, v, iv, 57, quotes
the Rituale of Corbie: ‘ Item, sciendum est, quod de jure canonico et scripto omnes
religiosi . . . . si fuerint per annum continuum in aliqua ecclesia portantes habitum
religionis illius loci, et habuerint quindecim annos completos ς tunc tales religiosi dicuntur
de jure scripto tacite protessi, et tenentur remanere per totam vitam suam in praedicta
religione, nisi fuerint dispensati per papam ⁸. The phrase reddere refers to the final aband-

ontnceintti of the world by actual signing of the deed of profession, which these monks had
