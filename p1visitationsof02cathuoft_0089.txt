ANKERWYKE· PRIoRY, 1441 7 ’

side thereof whereof he shall give them notice and concerning which
he shall cause them to be forewarned, appointing them such term in the
same chapter-house in presence of him or his commissary‚ to proceed
and watch further process in the said business according to what is
agreeable with the canonical institutes, master John Depyng, Thomas
Thorpe and Ι Colstone being present. On and in the which day and -
place masters John Depyng and John Leeke, being specially deputed in
common and severally to proceed, etc, in such business and to inquire of
and touching the observance of the injunctions and mandates which had
otherwise been prescribed in the form of a letter to the prioreSS, her
fellow—nuns and the sisters, having in the first place called together and
set before them the said prioress and convent, caused a commission for
so proceeding and inquiring to be read through by me Bugge13 and
when this had been read, the aforesaid Depyng publicly expounded the
same commission, at any rate its purport, in the vulgar tongue to the
same nuns, and having done this, the same deputy, wishing first and
before all to obtain the clearest and fullest information and assui-ance
touching the observance or want of observance of such injunctions, as he
affirmed, caused all the nuns save the prioress to go out of the chapter-
house, and proceeding in such business of the inquiry, having required
the same prioress to tell the truth in virtue of obedience, diligently
examined her touching the injunctions all and several, and whether she, ,
her fellow-nuns and the sisters have observed or not observed the same
injunctions or any of them. And she answering said that such injunctions
were, and are well observed as regards both her and her sisters in effect

and according to their power, except the injunction whereby she is bound
N to supply to her sisters sufficient raiment for their habits, and as touching
the non-observance of that injunction she answers that she cannot
observe it because of the poverty and insufficiency of the resources of
the house, which have been much lessened by reason of the want of a
surveyor or steward. Wherefore she besought my lord's goodwill and
assistance that he would deign with charitable consideration to make
provision of such steward or director. Then dame Isabel Standone,
Margery Kyrkby, Julia Messangere, sister Thomasine Talbot, Agnes
Dycher‚ sister Margaret Smythe and Ellen [Moretone], having been
examined severally and separately touching the several injunctions, said
all and each of them that all such injunctions were· and are observed ;
nevertheless each nun besought that provision be made to them of
sufficient and fitting raiment for their habits, or else that ten shillings be
given to every nun year by year for her raiment, according to the olden
custom of the house. And when these nuns all and several had been so
examined and were gathered together again in the chapter-house, the
said Depyng gave consideration to two grievances‚ wherein the priory
and nuns alike suffer no small damage, the which, as he affirmed, were
worthy of reform above the rest of those that stood most in need of
reform, to wit the lack of raiment for the habit, of bed-clothes and of a
steward or seneschal, but in- these matterS, as he averred, he could not
apply a remedy for the nonce without riper deliberation and consultation
with my lord ; wherefore with the consent of the said master John
Leeke he adjourned such visitation even as it then stood until and unto

Bugge taking his place. There is no change in the handwriting of the original.
