Also he says that the prior took with him to London' a common seal
of the house ad causas, under which he borrowed 340 marks without the

knowledge of the convent.

Also he says that the prior, albeit the convent protested and was un-
willing, granted to one sir William Westwode‚ chaplain of my lady the
countess of Stafford‚1 a yearly pension of torty shillings for the term of
ten years, to be received from the church of Southwick,² and gave five
marks to Ralph Clerke, to the end that he should suggest concerning him
to the said my lady the countess that he should be preferred [to the

priory] a second time.³

The same prior bought certain merchandise, namely flaxen and
woollen eloth, in London to the amount of eighty pounds, and sold it
again for two-thirds of that sum without the knowledge of the convent.

prior with both daughters of the same Maud, and with the same Maud

as well.

in very heavy sums of money that could not be borne. and especially, after
that my lorcl had discharged him of his administration and had put others
in his place in such administration with the consent of him and his con-
vent, he put the house in debt to the sum of twenty-three pounds and
more without the knowledge of the convent.

venerunt⁴ and other wonted psalms with suffrages and collects at masses

matins, masses and vespers only, albeit the sacrist is bound by virtue of
his office, for certain rents assigned to the same office for this purpose,
to find a lamp continually burning before the sacrament. Let an injunc-
tion be made.

Also he says that at the recitation of the hours there are only three
