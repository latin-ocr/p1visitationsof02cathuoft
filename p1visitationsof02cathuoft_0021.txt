From the foregoing detailed account, it will be seen that the quires,
with the lost quire and those composed of loose leaves omitted, were
begun in the following chronological order: 1, 4, 9, 12, 10, 2, 8, 6
(probably), 7, 3, 11, 14, 15,16,18. These, with the exception of 18,
which belongs to 1447, cover a period from 10 Deo, 1437, to 27 March,
1441. 2, 6, 7 and 18 each refer to a single visitation of one house. 11
belongs entirely to the Lincoln visitation of 1440, 14 and 15 belong to
the Leicester visitation of 1440-1. The composition of 12 has already
been analysed 3 it was begun at Markby in 1438, continued in Stow arch-
deaconry in April, 1440, and augmented during the Lincoln visitation in
October, 1440, by adding four outer sheets. 3, begun at Huntingdon in
1439, was also used in the Stow and Lincoln visitations of 1440. 1,

e begun at Peterborough in 1438, was continued at Markyate in May, 1442,

and was used with 4, 8, 10 and 12 in the Northampton visitation of June
and July, 1442. Blank leaves of. 4 and 16 were filled up at two small
priories of Huntingdon archdeaconry in Nov., 1442 3 and 16, begun at
Dorchester in March, 1441, was employed for the Bedford visitation of

The loose leaves, now fastened into quires, belong to the Leicester visita-
tion of 1440, the Northampton visitation of 1442, and the visitations of
St. Michael’s at Stamford in 1445 and of Peterborough in 1446. This
summary, it is hoped, will serve to explain the apparently complicated
and disorderly arrangement of the original MS„ which is actually due to
the notaries’ economy in the use of paper.

The water-marks of the paper are as follows. (1) Quire 1, a slung
hunting-horn. (2) Quire 2, a bust with the hair filleted: thiS, of a
distinctly negro type, occurs again in the outer sheet of quire 6 (ff. 44,

· 47), throughout quire 10, and in the fifth and sixth sheets (originally

outer sheets) of quire 12 (ff. 84, 85, 90, 91). (3) Quire 3, outer sheet (ff.
16, 31), an ox's head, full face, from the hollow between the horns of
which rises a vertical line ending in a star οἱ five points, formed by
crossing the line with two diagonals. (4) Quire 3, inner sheets (ff. 17-30),
a cap or crown-shaped figure, with three sugat-loaf shaped projectionS,
the two at the sides set diagonally, the middle one, which is higher‚
vertically.¹ From the top of this last rises a vertical line ending in a

approximates in character to the rougher forms οἱ the fleur-de-lys water-mark.
