xxxviii IN TROD UCTION

Nettleham. On 17 June he returned to Sleaford and, two days after, set
out from Stamford upon the visitation of the archdeaconry of Northamp-
ton, which hitherto he does not seem to have visited fully in person.
The progress of this visitation was as follows :

June, 1442. 19, St. Michael’s priory, Stamford. 22, Pipewell, a
date which points to an intermediate visitation of the deaneries of
Rutland and Weldon. 23, Peterborough abbey; 26, Fotheringhay
college 3 28, Tichmarsh ς 29, 30, Irthlingborough college. This progress
through the deaneries bordering the Nene valley was steadily continued
next month.

July, 1442. 1, Higham Ferrers college3 2, 3, Wellingborough;
7, St. James' abbey, Northampton ; 11, Brackley hospital¹ 3 12,
Chacombe priory ; 13, Canons Ashby priory; 15, 16, Daventry priory ;
17, Daventry, Catesby priory, Yelvertoft3 21, Rothwell priory. From
this point he came, probably by way of Liddington, to Sleaford, where
or at Nettleham (17 August) he remained until, late in the month, he
came to London. From 12 September to 28 October his main place of
abode, allowing for some non-personal dates, was Wooburn, from which,
on 15 and 16 September, he went to Oxford‚ while, on 10, 11 and 15
October, documents are dated from ‘Charleton.'²

Buckden, after a longer absence than usual, became his head-

o un mg on arc eaconr ⁹. e a es are scau y, viz. ε 20 ovem-
ber, Stonely priory; 29, Ashwell, HertS.; 30, Wymondley priory;
11 December, St. Mary's, Huntingdon. Liddington occurs on 16,
Nor-thampton on 17 and 18 December ; but Christmas probably was
spent at Buckden, where we find the bishop on 11 January, 1442-3.

The second half of January was employed in the visitation of
Bedford archdeaconry. The dates are: 15, Bletsoe; 16, Harrold
priory; 17, Turvey; 18, Newnham priory; 19, St. John’s hospital,
Leicester (an obvious mistake for Bedford) ; 20, Woburn abbey, an
exempt house which was a little out of the way 3 21, Elstow abbey;
24, Dunstable priory ; 28, Biggleswade 5 29, Northill college.

The bishop now returned to Buckden (1 February) and so, by
Liddington (7-15 February), to Sleaford (20 February). From now
until 28 June, 1443, he was chiefly at Nettleham and Lincoln (29 March-
16 May, 1443) and at Sleasord (20 February-17 March, 1442-3, and
23 May-28 June, 1443. Two visits to the dean and chapter of Lincoln
are marked on 29 April and 20 May,⁸ and on 12 May there is a date from
Benniworth. London and Wooburn occur early in July (8-10 and 13)
and again from 23 August to 1 September ; but there is an intermediate
period at Liddington (18 July-18 August). During this period, the
bishop paid a visit of a few days to Lincoln, where the altercations of
deanand chapter called for constant attention. This is clearly marked
by a date from Sewstern, on the borders of Leicestershire and Lincoln-
shire and on the road from Liddington to Lincoln (3 August), by the

 

 

¹ A visitation of St. John's hospital. Northampton‚ seems to have been contemplated
for the same day, but was not held. See no. XLIX below.

² There is no means of identifying this place with certainty. Charlton—on—Otmoor,
Oxon, seems not improbable ; but Charwelton, Northants. near Davemry, may be meant.
