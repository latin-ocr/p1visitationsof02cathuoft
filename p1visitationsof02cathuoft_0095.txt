coln, there appeared before the reverend father in Christ and lord, the
lord William, by the grace of God bishop of Lincoln, as on and in the
same day, year and place he was sitting in his capacity of judge for the
performance by him of his visitation in that place as ordinary, brother
John Waynflete,1 abbot of the said monastery, and the monks of the same
place all and several, save only brother William Waynfiete, who was hin·
dered by grievous sickness, in readiness, as was apparent, to undergo with
lowliness the visitation of the said reverend father. And then first and
before all else the worshipful master Thomas Duffeld, at the bidding of
the said reverend father, set forth the word of God in agreement with the
[process] about to take place, after this text, ‘Visit this vine'. And when
this sermon, very elegantly delivered in the Latin tongue, was finished
. . . . the lord abbot shewed to the said reverend father his certificate of
the mandate of the said reverend father which had been addressed to the
same abbot for the performance of such visitation in that place, in these
words, ‘To the reverend [father] in Christ‚’2 etc. And after this had
been read through, the same abbot shewed to the said reverend father
the foundation of the said monastery, in these wordS, ‘ To all the
sons of holy mother church, Gilbert of Ghent,' etc.⁸ He shewed also
the title of his incumbency, to wit, the confirmation of his election and
the letters patent for his installation.⁴ He shewed also the state of the
monastery,⁵ which he left in the hands of the said reverend father 3 and
then he swore obedience to the said reverend father in the accustomed
form. And after this, when all but me the notary and the witnesses
written beneath had been sent out of the said chapter-house, he proceeded

to the examination of the said abbot and examined him touching those

things pertaining to religious discipline and the other concerns of the
said monastery ς and he, being thus examined, says those things which
follow: ‘Brother John Waynflete, the abbot, being examined sayS,'
etc. And after him he examined brother William Burghe‚ the sub-prior,
who deposes those things [which] follow after the sayings of the abbot.
And, having examined* him, he committed to‘master John Depyng, his
chancellor, his office of examining all the rest of the monks and reporting
to him concerning the matters discovered by him. The which [John],
proceeding in the business of such inquiry, examined the rest that had
not been examined previously, to wit, in the first place, brother John
Bracy,⁶ the sacrist, then brother William Langtofte, the precentor, brother
William Croyland, the warden of the infirmary, brother Henry,⁷ the
