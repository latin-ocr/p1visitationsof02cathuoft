wit upon brother John Shrovesbury, whom he did prick in the breast
with a staff called a bill; and another time thei-easter, when he would
have stricken the same brother John again with a great knife and
,ῖςῖ the same [John] fied from him, he did strike several times with the
same knife one brother Ralph, canon of the same place, who then
set himself between them, and brake in pieces the bow of himself

 

John Frankeleyne, which the same Ralph did snatch up and hold against

Ϊ··ἶ, him for the defence of his body, and did thrash the same Ralph
24⁴5 grievously without bloodshed. The same John Frankeleyne did also lay
violent hands upon brother NicholaS, canon of the said place, and struck
{f him with his fist ; and albeit the abbot of the said place has sure infor-
tr mation of these offences, yet he does naught towards the correction or
{[J- removal of the same John Frankeleyne z wherefore the canons do take
it hardly and pray that provision be made them of a remedy by my lord.

INJUNCTIONS FOR DORCHESTER.

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the abbot and convent of the monastery of Dorchester, of
the order of St. Austin, of our patronage and diocese, health, grace and

blessing. Seeing that we ought by all means to cherish holy religion
'ss - when it has been planted, in no case do we perform this better than by

taking care to nourish those things which are right and correct those
things which hinder the advancement of virtue by the authoritycom-
mitted to uS. [Being moved] therefore by the consideration of these
things, etc., as in [the injunctions for] the monastery of the meadows of

η, x Leicester.1

 

In the first place, because we have found it disclosed to us that in
the said monastery no fixed hour is observed for rising to matins by
night, and this because the clock which should strike all the hours
byday and by night is not kept in good condition, besides this, that you,
the sacrist, have now of your wilfulness turned the cords or ropes that
belong thereunto to foreign useS, by reason whereof the canons do go to
the canonical hours at unaccustomed times, some sluggishly, some late
and some not at all ς and so the canonical hours are chanted neither by
day nor by night, as they should be, at the due time ; we enjoin there-
fore upon you, the abbot and sacrist who now are and shall be hereafter,
and upon you who now are and shall be canons, under the penalties of
contempt and disobedience, that you, the abbot and sacrist, do cause the
said clock to be repaired sufficiently and with all the speed you may and
to be brought back to its erstwhile condition, so that it may be able
agreeably to strike the hours by day and by night, that so fixed hours may
be observed for chanting the divine office ; and that you all after one
manner do rest by night in the dorter and, shaking off all drowsiness and
sloth, do rise, at any rate those of you who are of sound health and
ability, for matins and be present at the same.²

Also under the same penalties we enjoin upon you all and several,
who now are and shall be, that every day after vespers have been sung

 

 

 

¹ These will be found in their proper place.

² The compertum is founded upon John Henrethe’s first detectum. The cancelled
passages threaten the additional penalty of the greater excommunication, and allow an
exception to the rule for attending matins to the officiaris exteriores.
