15. Also she wears shifts of cloth of ReyneS,¹ which costs sixteen
pence the ell. She denies the article.

16. Also she wears kirtles laced² with silk and tiring-pins of silvei·
and silves-gilt, and has made all the nuns wear the like. She confesses
the article so far as regards her own wearing: she has sworn that she
will reform these things and has sworn to perform her penance, etc. 1

[17.] Also she wears above her veil a cap of estate furred with
budge.⁸ She confesses thereto; it is, however, on account of divers
infirmities in her head : she has sworn as above that she will reform
these thin s.

[18.]gA1s0 she furnishes not nor for three years’ space has furnished
fitting habits to the nuns, insomuch that the nuns go about in patched
clotheS. The threadbareness oi the nuns was apparent to my lord.

[19.] ,Also the prioress did invite several outside folk from the
neighbourhood to this visitation at great eost to the house, saying to
them ‘ Stand on my side in this time of visitation, for I do not want to
resign '. She confesses the entertainment ot her friends, but it was not
to this end.

20. Darne Juliane Messangere says that their hay and other grains
are stored in the church, by reason of the want of barns, which in the
neglect of the prioress are gone to ruin. She confesses the storage.

Also in the second year that the prioress came to this place the
sheep-sold of the house was burned up, and she has never made repair
thereos since, by reason whereof their hay is stored as above ; nor does

· r she make any repairs, and, albeit some have given somewhat to the doing

oi repairs, the prioress keeps for herself what she will of what is given,
without making sufficient repair. She alleges that repairs have been
done in her time, touching which she has shewn my lord a paper whereby
it appears that these repairs were done about the church.

Also the copses are destroyed in default of the prioress, as above ;
and herein she agrees in all things with Kyrkeby.

[21.] Also the prioress brings into the priory divers strangers and
unknown folk both male and female, and maintains them at the common
cost of the house, and makes nuns of some that are almost witless and
others that are incapable. She denies the article.

[22.] Also she treats the nuns her sisters in harsh wise, even when
their friends come to visit them.

23. Also the younger nuns have not a governess to instruct them in
reading and song. Provision of the sub-prioress has been made to them.⁴

24. Also the prioress comes rarely to matins or masseS, and when
she comes, she chides the nuns and speaks to them upbraidingly.

2 5. They had not serving-folk in the brewhouse, bakehouse or
kitchen from the last festival οἱ the Nativity of St. John the Baptist last
year to the Michaelmas next following, insomuch that this deponent, with

the aid oi other her sisters, prepared the beer and victuals and served
the nuns with them in her own person.
