DAVENTRY PRIORY, 1442 64

out into the town.

My lord set forth to them three ways, by one of which the house
might flourish better; to wit, either that the prior do resign, or that,
setting aside all diligence on his own account, he do wholly mind religion
alone, and a wary person, provided that he be a clerk, be hired to direct
the temporal administration‚ or that all things be put to farm and that
they do live in common. [They have] till the morrow to take counsel
touching these thingS, which way they will take for the better govern-
ance of the house, that they may inform him of the way when they have
chosen it. And so my lord adjourned his visitation till the morrow at
noon, Depyng, Thorpe, Bug and I Colstone being present. At the
which term, as the said reverend father was sitting in his capacity of
judge, there appeared before him the prior and all the monks ; and then
my lord suspended the prior from all administration of temporal affairs
and entrusted it to brother Richard¹ Watforde, on condition that he do
take to himself a trusty one of his brethren to give diligent attention to
the kitchen and cellar, that the bread, beer and other provisions be faith-
fully kept and served out, for whom he may be willing to answer. And
then he enjoined upon the prior in virtue of obedience and under pain
of contempt that he do mind quire and religion, and that on this side
Michaelmas next, on some day this side whereof he shall have had
notice, he do shew my lord a clear account of his administration for his
whole time. And then my lord charged the prior with the crime of
adultery with Agnes Masone, the wife of Robert Masone of Daventry ;
the which crime the same prior denied. Wherefore my lord appointed
for the same prior the third hour after noon in the same place to clear
himself with six of the elder and more trustworthy of his brethren, etc.
And at this time and place the prior appeared before my lord and

⁷ brought forward no compurgators, but submitted himself to my lord’s

grace and so confesses that he has made default in his purgation. And,
when nothing was advanced by him, he was declared so to have made
default and to be a convicted person; and then he forswore the said
woman and all manner of familiar converse with the same henceforth,
and the penance to be enjoined upon him on that account is left in
suspense until my lord’s return to this place. And then the same reverend
father adjourned such his visitation until the morrow of that day,
Depyng, Thorpe, Bug and I Colstone being present. At the which
term, to wit, on the 17th day of the said month of July in the said chapter-
house before the same reverend father sitting in his capacity of judge,
there appeared the said prior and convent; and at and with the nomina-
tion, petition and consent of all he deputed brother William Watforde‚
the sub-prior, to be administrator of all the temporal goods of the priory
while the suspension aforesaid lasted, and committed to him the admin-
istration of all such goodS, when he had taken an oath to administer and
give account faithfully. And then, after the letters of such commission
had been delivered to him under my lord's seal and also under the
common seal of the said place, with the consent, etc., my lord adjourned
such his visitation until Monday next after the feast of St. Andrew next
to come,² Depyng and Ι Colstone being present.
