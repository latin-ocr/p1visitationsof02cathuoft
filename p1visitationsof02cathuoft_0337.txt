THE VISITATION οιῗ THE PRIORY OF HEYNINGS‚ oF THE ORDER
OF CiTEAux, oF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE oN THE 7TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF
APRIL, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1440, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHmST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM, ΒΥ THE
GRACE OF Gon BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR
OF H1s CONSECRATION AND THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the business of such visitation, on and in the day,
year and place aforesaid, there appeared the prioress and convent of the
said priory to undergo, as was apparent, such visitation; and then first
and before all else the word of God was set forth according to this text,
‘All the building framed together groweth to an- holy temple in the
Lord‚' etc. And when this was finished as befitted them that heard it
and beseemed the process about to take place, dame Joan Hothum, the
prioress,5 furnished my lord with her certificate touching my lord’s
mandate which had been addressed to the same prioress for this
business, under this form, ‘To the reve1·end,’etc. And after this had
been read through and when all that had been summoned had made
their appearance, the said prioress sware canonical obedience, and then
she exhibited the certificate of the confirmation of her election without
that of her installation. Thereafter she exhibits the foundation charter⁶
and the state of the house, but concerning the chantries that are founded
therein she exhibited naught, because, as she says, she has not the
foundation deeds to her hand. And then on her examination she says
that all things are well. ·

The nuns have access too often to the house of the treasurer of
Lincoln‚⁷ abiding there sometimes for a week.

Dame Isabel Burtone‚⁸ the sub-prioreSS, says that all things are well.

 

 

⁷ ’.[ἒιε treasurer at this time was John Haget or Heygate, for whom see V1251'tatzbns Ι,

75’3 ZI‘he names of the nuns are in several instances those of gentle families. The prioress
and Isabel Pudsey bear Yorkshire names. Other gentle names are those of Sunon,
Pakyngton. Asshemn, and Dawtre. The sub-prioress may have come from the neighbouring
village of Gate Burton ; Ellen Bryg was probably from Brigg in Lincolnshire ; Ellen Cotum
from Cottam in Nottinghamshire, just across the Trent 3 and Katherine Hoghe from
Hough-on the-Hill, between Liucoln and Grantham.
