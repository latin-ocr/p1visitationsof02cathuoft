BARDNEY ABBEY, 1440 29

day went to see his parents, and Rose, who is at the point to die.¹ And,
when he had set forth at that time the reason of his coming, to make
visitation, to wit, by reason 01 1116 sealing 01 blank parchments with the
common 5631, 01 1116 keys that guard the which the abbot has one,
William Waynflete the other and Langtofte the third ; and after the rest
had been sent out, then the abbot, having been sworn, says [as follows}

He says that he has 11311 01 1116 common seal² and one key. He
says further that within the past fortnight he delivered his key to the
two other guardians 01 1116 5631 101 1116 sealing 01 3 p1·oxy.⁸ Being
interrogated whether the lock belonging to his key was shut immediately,
he says that he does not know ; 116 believes, however, that it was ε albeit
he was in the treasury, he did not notice this.4 And he believes that he
delivered such key to the said guardians between the 163515 01 Matthew
and Michael 1351.ὅ Being interrogated 11 116 knows whether any empty
sheets or blank parchments are or have been sealed with the common
seal or with the seal 01 1115 office, he says plainly no. Then, leaving
the chapter-house, 31111 coming back again into 1116 chapter-house at
once, he says that yesterday morning he handed over his 5631 10 1116

011161 guardians 101 1116 sealing 01 3 proxy, and they immediately gave
him back his key.

Brother Alan Kyrketone, the prior, being sworn and interrogated
concerning the premises, says that he was the first to be aware 01 511611
doing. Interrogated who they were that did such thing, he says that
brothers William Langtofte, William Waynfiete, Henry Lincolne 31111
John Hole held treaty in the chapter-house 31161 matins by the space 01
311 hour, and then two 01 1116111 went to their beds, and the two others
entered the treasury and took and carried off the common seal, and did
seal such blank sheets in the sacristy, and did leave pieces 01 parchment
there. And he says that he had this on the information 01 John Bracy,
who saw them in such 361 01 sealing. And he believeS, as he says, that
Bartone is the chief instigator 01 511611 wickedness, inasmuch as about the
feast 01 1116 Assumption⁶ Bartone said openly, ‘The bishop has no such
jurisdiction in the monastery that he can dispose 01 1116 monies 01 1116
monastery ε rather will we lay out all that we have in the monastery to
defend ourselves against him.' And he says that they, who scaled have
no skill in drawing up proxies.

Brother William Burghe, the prior,⁷ being sworn and interrogated
concerning such treaties and sealing and the debt, and 11 1116 buildings
ἓξ ttlhezenffiplagsgery be not duly kept in repair, says that he knows naught

Brother John Bracy, being sworn and examined, says that immedi-
ately and there and then after matins he heard Lincolne, Langtoft,

⁸ The object of this proxy is not stated. It would, however, empower a promor, un·
specified in the text, to conduct business in the name of the abbot and convent, and that
this business involved money transactions is certainly implied in the sequel.

⁴ The construction in the Latin implies the abbot’s answers to two successive interro·
gatories, viz. Was he in the treasury at the time? Yes. Did he notice this? No. The
correct report would be : licet esset in thesauraria, hoc tamen non respiciebat.

⁵ Le. between 21 and 29 Sept.

⁶ I.e. 15 August. ,

⁷ Apparently an error sor sub-prior, the office held by Burghe in 1437-8. But Wayn·
flete is called sub-prior lower down.
