Latin speech, in accordance with the process about to take place, by the
man of mark master Thomas Duffelde, bachelor in divinity, after this text,
⁴ Go and see if all things be well with thy brethren.' And when this was
finished praiseworthily, the prior delivered to my lord the certificate of
the mandate which had been addressed to him by my lord on behalf of
this business. composed after these wordS‚ ‘To the reverend,' etc. The
which having been read through, the prior displayed several [writings]
concerning the foundation and the alteration of the house,l the certificate
of confirmation of his election,² the state of the house and the 111111113110113,3
albeit those concerning the first matter in a short form⁴; concerning which
my lord said that he would take counsel. And so, after obedience and
fealty had been sworn by the prior, the same prior on examination says
these things which follow.

Brother Henry Dalby,⁵ the prior, says that, while all without
distinction do wear boots,⁶ brother John Knyvet, by reason of the sore
weakness which he has in his shinS,‘¹ wears no boots, howbeit with the
same prior's permission, under favour of a dispensation.

Brother William Wylingtone, the sub-prior, says that divine service
is said with too much abridgment and without the due pauses, and
therefore with too'little devotion.

Also the prior says that the house is bound to a mass of the blessed
Virgin in the parish church of the town,⁸ to be celebrated daily therein
by one of the house or by a secular chaplain at the prior’s bidding, the
which thing is verily observed without ceasing.9 ⁶

Brother John Knyvet says that all things are well.

Now, when these had been examined and the prior and convent had
been called together, my lord adjourned his visitation in the state wherein
it then was until Monday‚ then being the next day ; and in his commission
he committed to master John Depyng, who was then present, the power

⁸ The foundation deed of the chantry college provided 10r this According to the first
foundation, the warden of the college was to find another chaplain at his own costs to
celebrate‘ in ecclesia parochiali eiusdem villae. ' By the later foundation, Roger Beler made
over the advowson of the parish church of St. Mary to the warden 311ἀ chaplains. The
parish church cf St. Mary and the collegiate chapel or conventual church of St. Peter were
two distinct buildings. she dedication of the conventual church is now applied to the
handsome parish church, which is 011311 supposed to have been the church οἱ 1113 priory; but
the plan 13 purely that of 3 parish church, and the language of the foundation deeds s‘news
that the chap el of St. Peter was the manorial 31131131 belonging to the Belers, and not a part
of the parish church, nor is there any indication 11131 11133 331ν1333 os the priory were ever

some doubt about the observance.
