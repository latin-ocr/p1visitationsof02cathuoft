KYME PRIORY,· 1440 170

Also he says that the cellarer holds the office of sacrist.

Also he says that brother John Suttertone holds the offices of the
almonry, the frater, subcellarer‚ parish chaplain‚ and master of the fens.¹

Also he says that the prior holds the office of kitchener.

Also he says that the parishioners make their offerings at the high
altar in quire on days when oblations should be made, going and
returning through the midst of the quire.

Also he says that no provision is made of doctors and medicines for
the sick at the costs of the house.

Also he says that Hardyng2 continually, and strangers for a day
at a time, do sit in the frater among the canons at their meals; and
Hardyng pays only twenty pence in the week for himself or for what he
gets.

Also he says that the craftsmen and household servants do eat daily
in the frater by themselves at a separate and lower table.

Also he says [that] he minds the cure of souls at Northolme only by
commission and at the appointment of the prior, and it is said that a
canon should be instituted in the same by the bishop, and touching this,
as it is alleged, there are apostolic privileges. [The prior] has a term on
this side Easter to e‘xhibit the privileges whereby they may cause the
cure to be served by one of their canons.

Brother Thomas F eltwelle says that the canons stayin g at Northolme
did of custom dwell together on their commons3 and now they are in
separate places, and not in their dwelling-place that is ordained for them.
The prior was enjoined to make provision that from henceforth they
board together in the house ordained in that place for thern to dwell in,
on this side the feast of All Saints, under pain of paying forty shillings
from the common goods of the house to the fabric-fund of the church of
Liueoln. (Let my lord see concerning the foundation of Northolme.)

Also he says as above [concerning] the subcellarer, that he holds
more than one office.

Also he says that brother John Mace holds the offices of cellarer and
sacrist and applies the profits of one office to the other, whereby one is
made worse and the other is bettered.

Also he says that the pittances⁸ which have been of long time
accustomed are now coming into disuse.

Also he says that the clerk of the church is neglectful in ringing for
the hours, and this because the sacrist is much away from the house
about foreign business, in his office of cellarer, and therefore minds not
the church or the office of the sacristy.

Also he says that the doors of the church, the cloister and the
dorter are not shut and opened at convenient and fitting seasons, for the
prior carries the keys of these doors.

Also he says that the prior’s chamberlain lies by night within the
dorter.

Brother Thomas Blytone, the precentor and guest-master, says that
the clerk of the church is somewhat neglectful and slack in his office: as
regards other things, he says all things are well.

Witham as far as Boston. Suttertone's business, no doubt, was to look after the fisheries
and cutters of reeds and peat in the fens belonging to the priory. >
