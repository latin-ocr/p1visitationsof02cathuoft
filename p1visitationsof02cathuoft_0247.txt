ELsHAM PRIORY, 1440 87

not [learned] and are of mature age, it is not likely that they will learn
any more; and when he first entered the priory, he found therein but
one canon only, a very old man. And he says that all are almost given
over to eating and drinking to the great loss ot the house.

Also he says that the youngest ot‘ all the canons is somewhat rebel-
lious to the prior.

Also he says that they pay no heed to religious discipline or the
regular observances ; and Yorke especially, since he is almost a laymanl,
IS verAblsgusffszcilnlgptlliratitilierchgdiilste is bound to supply a canon to celebrate
five days every week in the chapel of Kettleby, which is three miles dis-
tant from the house? and there are now only two canons in priests' orders
who are old and almost blind, the said prior beseeches the lord bishop
for his grace, so to govern such business with sir William Tirwhit that
such canon should have power to celebrate in the priory for those souls
on whose behalf he should celebrate in the said chapel.

Also he says that the chapel ot Usselby, [which is] within the parish
of Kirkby and is parcel of the church ot Kirkbyss, is held by one who
receives all the tithes and oblations of the same chapel to the great
prejudice of the same churoh and the vicar in the same and of the priory.

Also he says that Robert York is very unruly and in the habit of
making excursions outside the priory without leave.

Brother William Hede says that the three other canons wish to live
sumptuously and delicately3 and albeit suitable provision according to
the resources of the house is made thern, they always do grumble unless
they have provision according to their desire, and they are profitable in
nothing, seeing that they are not taught the rule nor [will be] taught.

Also he says that Yorke gets drunk easily, and is then so quarrelsome
and cross that to live with him is irksome to all.

Brother John Appelby, sixty years old and upwardS. as he says,
[says] that all things are well.

Brother Robert Yorke, sometime a hermit, now a professed canon,
having only the first tonsure, [is] without understanding ot' what he
reads, as he says himself.

Brother Thomas Bartone says that, when he entered religion, his ’

purpose was to 'make progress in letters and religious discipline, and this
the prior did promise him ; and yet he has made progress in naught of
these, seeing that there is no one there to teach him, and therefore he is
not instructed. He prays that he may be able to be taught.

And When these had been examined, my lord [aforesaid] was sitting
as a tribunal in his capacity of judge in the business of such his visitation
in the said year and place ; and there appeared before him the said
canons. And then my lord made public the matters disclosed and dis-
covered in such inquiry, and then he admonished all.4
