 

DAVENTRY PRloRY, 1442 63

(Against the prior.) Also Thomas Bayly of Daventry, lately deputed
as sub-collector of the tenth by the prior as collector, keeps sixteen
pounds of the same tenth in his own hands, for the recovery of the
which the prior does not prosecute, albeit he has been asked to do so by
the convent 3 and for this charge the said Thomas had five marks. The
prior confesses that the sixteen pounds remain in the hands of the said
Thomas

(Against the prior.) Also he says that the prior did grant under his
seal to one John West of Daventry a yearly pension of twenty shillings
and a gown of the livery of the house¹ without the consent of the con-
vent, albeit he has knowledge or can avail the priory in naught. He
denies the grant.

(Against the prior.) Also the prior did grant to John Horne of
Daventry a yearly pension of five marks that he might stand by the
monastery at law, and yet rather against the priory than on the side of
the lgou'se.² (fle confesses the bargain with the same John, but he has
not een pai .

(Against the prior.) Also, after he had the tenth when last he was
collector thereos, the prior by careless keeping lost twenty marks,
whereof the house did make satisfaction. He denies the payment by
the house, but [says that it was paid] out of his own allowance.

Against the prior.) Also the vicar of Daventry⁸ keeps a horse
whic abides in the house at its chargeS‚ and the prior’s donzel⁴ has
another and the prior two3 and when anyone must needs go a-riding
on the business of the house, he may not have a horse but for hire. The
prior was warned that the vicar’s horse shall be wholly removed from
the house and from the costs of the house.

(Clerks are not kept.) Brother Heni-y Irtlyngburghe says that they

mass, save one only, who is so busy with his studies⁶ that he cannot
attend to this ; and he says as above concerning the vicar’s horse.

Brother Thomas Burghe says all things are well.

(Against the prior.) Brother William Suttone says that the rectory
house at Drayton⁰ is very ruinous‚ and so are several buildings belonging
to the priory that are almost fallen to the ground.

Brother Richard Daventre says all things are well.

Brother William Burghe says that all things are well.

Women have general resort to the kitchen and to the washing·places
in the cloister, where they get up on the edge to fill their pots at the
washing-places ; and so they befoul the same edge with their feet.⁷

Grandisson or Graunson of Exeter, and is described by him as domicellus noster (Exeter Reg.
Grandiss0n‚ ed. Hingeston Randolph, 11, 1015). ⁶

⁶ This may mean that he was at a university. but from the context it is more likely to
mean that he was a student in the local grammar-school.

⁶ Drayton adjoins Daventry on the west. There was no church or parish of Drayton,
and the house referred to must have been a grange. Possibly Drayton may be an error sor
Norton·by-Daventry‚ the church of which was appropriated to the prior and convent.
Other appropriated churches were Daventry with its chapel of Wehon, Fawsley, Preston
ξῗιρεε, staverton and West Haddon in Northamptonshire‚·and Foxton in Leicestershire.
