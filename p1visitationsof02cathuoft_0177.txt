⁸ This injunction is left unnumbered in the original.
⁹ abbess cancelled.
¹⁰ The rest is added in the margin.

made the regulations about leaving the dorter advisable. The prioress herself complained
of the breach ot the rule as to silence.
¹² This unnumbered injunction is added at the foot of the leaf. There is a reference
in the margin above. Α
¹³ See the detecta of the prioress concerning intercourse between the nuns and secular
persons.
