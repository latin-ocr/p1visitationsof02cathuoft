INTRODUCTION xix

presided at a diocesan synod at Norwich, the result of which was the
temporary suppression of Lollardy in that part of England. In
September, 1428, William White, who had renounced his heresy at
St. Paul's in 1422, was burned at Norwich as a relapsed heretic; and
this action terrified the local Lollards into reconciliation with the church.l
Although Alnwick took a prominent part in the educational movement
of his day, his zeal was for education upon orthodox lines; and, as
bishop of Lincoln, he continued to manifest his antipathy to heresy.
His Lincoln register throws no light upon the progress of Lollardy in the
diocese ; and, although he found much evidence of slackness and irrever-
ence in the monasteries, there is little ground for supposing that any house
had become infected with heterodoxy. Gascoigne supplies a specimen of
his dealing with a form of heresy which is not to be confounded with
Lollardy. A secular clerk of Oxford, a scholar in grammar, who had sat
at the feet of Reynold Pecok, fellow of Oriel, was accused to the king of
divers foul heresies and of eating flesh on F ridays. His case was
committed to Alnwick's judgment: he was imprisoned at Wallingford
and, having made abjuration before Alnwick, entered the ,monastery of
Abingdon, where he confessed upon oath that he had learned all his
heresies and errors from Pecok.2 This was before Pecok's promotion
to the bishopric of St. Asaph in 1444 ; and, although Pecok himself was
eventually forced in 1458 to resign his see of Chichester and to retire to
Thorney abbey, his peculiar form of heresy had little in common with
the popular tenets of the Lollards and was combined with a conservative
opposition to anti-clerical opinion. Of the superstitious practices,
distinct from theological heresies, with which Alnwick had to deal, a

¹ · Curious instance will be found in the charge of necromancy brought

against the abbot of Leicester³ 3 while in 1442 there came before him a
case which implicated a wizard named Thomas Paldych or Poudych of
Long Sutton.⁴ The proceedings of the Lincoln consistory court, of
which a large fragment remains for this period, record three cases of
alleged necromancy from Boston in 1446 and a few instances of suspected
Lollardy 3 but these last are of an inconclusive kind, and, in this respect,
Alnwick appears to have found less difficulty at Lincoln than at Norwich.

While the evidence for his actions as a visitor of monasteries in the
diocese of Lincoln is singularly perfect, we know little of his attitude to
the numerous monastic establishments of the diocese of Norwich. It
has not been possible for the present writer to examine his register at
Norwich, but writers upon East Anglian monasteries appear to have
derived little information from it. In the register of William Curteys,
abbot of Bury St. Edmunds 1429-46, he figureS, however, as a determined
opponent of the privileges of the abbey, a standing subject of contention
between the bishops of Norwich and the convent. ‘He uttered very
noisome words against the privileges and exemption of the monastery
and breathed forth a wind from the north with strength. But, blessed
be God, who leaveth not desolate them that hope in Him! He hath
fulfilled His mercy upon us, bridling of His grace the bishop's malice.
