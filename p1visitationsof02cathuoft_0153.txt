undergo such visitation. First and before all else the word Of God was
set forth, in agreement with the process that was about to take place,
in the Latin tongue by the honourable master John Beverley, professor
of holy writ, after this text, ‘Be ye clean, who bear the vessels of the
Lord,' etc. And, when this was done, my lord held further process as

follows.

Master Thomas MortOne‚ the master,² shewed certificates Of his
institution and induction, and the alteration of the condition of the
said hospital, which was sometime a condition Of religion, but has now
been changed tO the habit Of secular chaplains and clerks.³

Sir‘ John Spensere‚ member Of the college, shewed his letters Of
orders and swore obedience.

Sir John Bottone, member Of the college, shewed his letters of
orders and took the oath.

Sir John Cundale, stipendiary‚⁴ who celebrates in the same hospital,
shewed his letters Of orders and swore obedience.

On the twelfth day Of the month and year aforesaid and in the place
aforesaid, my lord inquired of the said master whether he performed the .
charges laid upon him by the new alteration Of the nature Of the hospital,
and whether he had paid the money which according to the ordinance
was tO be given to the poor.⁵ And he said plainly yes, seeing that he is
obliged by the bOnd Of his oath tO undergo them. And so my lord dis-
solved his visitation.

word was commonly used to denote a priest whose stipend was derived from money in the
hands of feoffees, as distinct from the priest whose chantry was a freehold benefice, consist-
ing in endowments of land and rent. In the Chantry certificate rolls, temp. Hen. VIII and
Edward VI, stipendiarius is almost invariably used in this special sense.
