LEICESTER ABBEY, 144o 212

’ ordinary, and he withholds from this Asty twenty shillings of [the money
’ for his raiment.

] (The abbot.) Also he says that this same Asty does writing in the
monastery, writing all things on parchment and paper ot' his own getting,
and there is no one who will make him satisfaction for his expenses in
the abbot's default.

Brother Robert Grene, the sub-sacrist, says as above concerning the
scarcity of canons, and that service is not done to the canons in the
infirmary, and as above concerning the multiplier and his serving-man.

(Note. The abbot. 4th.) Brother William Sadyngtone, the abbot,
is defamed of incest¹ with one Euphemia Fox, who sometime dwelt in
the priory of Langley. The same, whether as one wavering in faith or
straying from the faith and the fixed judgment of the catholic church,
did practice in his own person, contrary to such faith and fixed judg-
ment, divination or incantations after this manner, to wit, on the eve or
on the day of the feast of St. Matthew the apostle, in the year of our
Lord 1439,² at Ingarsby,⁸ he took to himself a boy, Maurice by name,
and, observing a damnable superstition, smeared the boy's thumb-nail,
bidding him look upon his nail and discover to him what sort of things
he saw there, and, reading or saying his charms the while, asked of the
same boy what he had seen, incurring the sentence of the greater excom-
munication passed against such persons in general ; and knowing himself
to be thus excommunicate, has since then celebrated masses, even in
solemrli wise4, and otherwise has taken part in divine service, incurring
irre u arit .

gThe ahbot received of Roger Buldra, sometime canon of this place,
twenty shillings for the admission of the same Roger’s kinsman into the
almonry. Also at another time in like manner six shillings and eight
pence.

(The sub-prior.) Also the sub-prior did receive of Thomas Belgrave
a new surplice‚ that he might have a share in the chantries.

(The abbot.) The abbot every year deposes and appoints ‘the
officers of the monastery without the advice of the convent; and whereas
the goods of the canons that die should be distributed among the poorer
canons after the election of the abbot, the prior and the others,⁶ the
abbot sells such goods after the election and puts the money in his purse,

contrary to the statutes of the order.
(14. The abbot.) Also, although it is believed that two hundred
marks or more accrued from the office of the cellarer during the time

 

 

 

 

the ecclesiastical court at York with practising crystal·gazing with ceremonies and incanta—
tions somewhat similar to those used by Sadyngton. lt is interesting to note that he said
that he had learned his art some three years before from one Arthur Mitton of Leicester
(York Reg. Geo. Nevill, fo. 69 and d ; printed in Arclzoeol. Journal, xm, 372·4.) One of
the most curious of all recorded instances of the mediaeval use of magic is the story (1510)
of the treasure said to be buried at Mixendale-head in the parish oi Halisax, in the rites for
recovering which an Austin canon of Drax and two secular priests took part (York Reg.
Bainbridge, ff. 68 sqq. ; printed thid. XVI, 71-81). Readers ot fiction will remember how
the time-honoured practice employed by Sadyngton was used by the soi-disant Indian
jugglers in Wilkie Collins’ The Moonstone, 1, ch. iii.

⁵ The meaning is t'nat, after the election of an abbot or prior, or the appointment of an
obedientiary or admission of a canon, upon the death of his predecessor, the custom was to
distribute the dead man's goods as stated. The fact that the existence of such goods was
recognised illustrates the decline ot strictness with regard to the offence of proprietas, which
was contrary to the whole spirit of monasticism.
