INTRODUCTION lxix

in 1490.l The statements embodied in its long preamble have been
interpreted‚ on the one hand, as definite charges founded on good
reason, which prove the moral decay of the house; while, on the other,
they have been impugned as pieces of mere gossip of which the
archbishop took advantage to interfere with the affairs of an exempt
monastery. On neither side, however, has the fact been properly
recognised that Morton's arraignment of the convent is in no sense an
unique document. A comparison of it with the documents printed.
above will show that it is merely a member of a fairly numerous class,
modelled upon forms which were well known in every episcopal

chancery ; and it is only by the recognition of this elementary point that
its real historical value can be appreciated.
