this deponent should have for the principal feasts; and that which he has
for ordinary days is of no value.

(The dean and the proctor.) Sir Robert Careby, canon, says that he
knows not how it stands with the college, because he knows of no

vl
ἔ ¹ accounts that have been rendered for several years.

 

(Walter.) Also he says that sir Walter after nones every day goes
to the taverns, insomuch that every night or every other night he is
drunk, and then he is past bearing among his fellows.

(The dean.) Also he says that they have not a stock of all things,

Also he prays that an injunction be made that no one upbraid his
neighbour because of the disclosures in this visitation. They were all
warned under pain of excommunication and of expulsion from the
college for ever, that no one should upbraid another by reason of the
disclosures in this visitation.

Sir John Burtone was appointed to make presentation of defaults in
quire, to present the defaults of the same [canons] in chapter next
Friday.

The dean was warned under pain of excommunication to correct by
himself or by his sub-dean the defaults presented according to the

statutes.

And the visitation was adjourned till the morrow in the morning.

Sir Walter Luffenham, canon of the college, commits adultery with
Agnes, the wife of John Stones the elder. The man appeared before my
lord in the vestry on the last day of June ; and, when the article was

The same sir William laid hands of violence in a case not allowed
by law upon sir Richard Smythe, canon in the same place, dragging him
down by his feet along the steps of the common‘hall.² The man appeared
on and in the said day [and] place, and, when the article aforesaid had
been laid to his charge, he first denied the fact. But afterwards, inas-
much as the said Richard, when asked by my lord, would not clear him
touching this, but said outright that it had thus been done, and the other
fellows who were [there] at the time bore witness to this same thing, he
confesses that the deed was done in a fit of passion. And then my
lord asked of him whether, since he so did this deed, he have celebrated
[mass]. He says and confesses yes ; howbeit he avers that he was
absolved from the sentence of excommunication which he incurred on
that account by the last bishop of Lincoln, who is now dead. Where-
fore my lord appointed him the Tuesday next to come in the church of
Wellingborough,² to shew sufficient proof of such absolution and to do

appeared before my lord, and because he exhibited nothing in accord-
