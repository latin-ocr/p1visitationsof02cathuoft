DORcHEsTER ABBEY, 1441 70

Also he says that cloister is not kept at the due hours for meditation
and readin

Also h} says as above of the accounts that they are not rendered by
the abbot.

Also he says that Marmyone is very burdensome to the house as
regards his serx 1ng -folk and them that corne to visit him, and says that,
as it seems to him it is not very expedient that the same [Marmyone]
should have so great governance with respect to the temporal affairs of
the house.

Also he says that while according to the rule their canons ought not
to go out either on foot or on horseback, save in closed cloaks only now
[howelver] they walk about in the open cloak s which are called quire
copes.1

Also he prays that ordinance be made that the canons who shall be
abiding in their seynies do go out together for their recreation and return
together, and not roam about by themselves, as is their wont, wherefrom
there springs exceeding scandal to the house.

Also he says that by the custom of the monastery there should be
appointed care-takers for the young canons, to lay out their private
allowance to their advantage until they be advanced to the priesthood‚ for
now the opposite of this is observed : he prays therefore that an injunc-
tion be made in this regard, since hereof follow divers evils.

The same has a hundred shillings2 for himself and two of his house-
hold, and meat and drink even as two canons, and this he has under the
common seal [by grant made] during the voidance of the monastery.

The abbot was enjoined in virtue of obedience and under the pains
of excommunication and deprivation to grant no corrody, annuity‚ pen-
sion or livery to anyone in perpetuity, for term of life or for a certain
time, save with the counsel„ consent and licence of the diocesan and
patron³ asked and had.

Brother Walter Dorchestre [is defamed] with Joan Barbour, a
married woman. He appeared and denies [his guilt] at any time. He
was ordered to clear himself with three of his brethren‚ and then
cleared himself according to the form bidden him. Also with the
wife of Thomas Deye, a serving-man in the monastery : then he cleared
himself with three of his brethren. He confesses to the impawning
of a gilded chalice to Marmyone for four nobles4 and the alienation
of five silver spoons belonging to the infirmary : the spoons were taken
away by stealth. The abbot was enjoined to cause these things to be
restored out of the same canon’s allowance. He confesses the possession
of hawks: the possession of such birds was forbidden him. He con-
fesses that he has lain divers times in the infirmary: he was enjoined
not to do this henceforward, unless by reason of bodily weakness and
with the abbot’ s leave; and he abjured the fellowship of the woman.

Nicholas Plymmouthe was taken . . . with the tanner' 3 wife

.- a‚nd in proof of such matter they that took them have their
shifts to shew. He denies his guilt at any time. He was ordered to
clear himself with three of his brethren3 but, because he is a defaulter
in his purgation‚ he was declared convicted. He was enjoined to be
kept 1n cloister and [to keep] silence for a week to be appointed by the
prior within the next three weeks, and to lay aside his shift on all eves
