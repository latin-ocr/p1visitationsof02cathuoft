Also we enjoin upon you the abbot, in virtue of obedience, that you
do cause a chantry which is called Peylonde, to the supply whereof the
monastery is bound, to be duly served according to the ordination of the
same chantry, that the souls of the founders of the same chantry may
not be unduly defrauded of the help of intercession.l

when this had been read through, the prior shewed the certificates of the
confirmation of his election and his installation,³ and then swore fealty and
obedience in the accustomed form. Then he exhibited the foundation of
the house as registered in a register of the house.⁴1 He did not present
