BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437·8 17

[Also] he says that certain monks during, as well as before and after
meals have no shame to ....... in the lewdest way, and if anyone
speak to them touching this, they straightway break forth into words
of abuse.

[Also] he says plainly that silence is kept in no place where accord-
ing to the institutes of their religion it should be kept.

[Also] he says that Bartone is not wary, because, when wheat and
other kinds of grain were cheap, he would buy none, nor even repair the
barns where their grain was laid up, insomuch that the grain is almost
wholly destroyed; and it is true that the same Bartone is os: no use for

any office.

(Against Bartone.) Brother William Langtoft‚ the precentor, says
that brother Thomas Bartone was to blame for the discharge of brother
William Waynflete from the office of prior, and he says that the same
brother Thomas is the source of all the mischies in the same monastery.

Also he says as above of the monks who do not complete their pro-
fession, though they have been in the state of profession for seven years.

Also he says as above of the dilapidation of the church‚ the quire
and the other buildings of the monastery.

Also he says that the chantries of Partney and Skendleby are cele-
brated in the monastery by the monks according to the ordinance of the
lord Richard, late bishop of Lincoln‚1 and yet service is not done after
the said ordina-nce to the monks who celebrate.

Also he says that every monk should receive yearly from the office
of the almonry twelve pence for a pair of knives² and twelve pence for

x “ spices‚³ and now brother Thomas Bartone, who fills that office, pays the

said monks nothing at all from that office, but the entire belongings of
the same office he even dilapidates and wastes.

Also the same, who fills the office of pittancer‚ should pay to each
monk twenty pence apiece five times [a year], and pays almost nothing
of this, but had himself discharged ot that office after the receipt of the

mandate. -

Also the same almoner should give to the poor sor the obitsof the
abbots and the monks on certain days certain dishes in the form of
bread, beer and kitchen-provision: yet the same on many days when
there were good dishes has given them not to the needy but to his
, friends. Sometimes he has taken away beer, sometimes bread, some-
times kitchen-provision‚ and has given them to his serving-folk contrary
to the pious intention of the founders.

(Against Bartone.) Also he says that it would please him well that
,they should live very sparingly‚ provided that it would grow to the
profit of the monastery, but that they themselves should live sparingly
“ without any advantage to the house would not be according to his will,
for this Bartone is a man of such governance that never did any office
prosper in his hand.

(Against the abbot.) Also since the office of the sacristship is scantily

 

among the later documents in the Bardney chartulary (MS. Cotton, Vesp. E, xx) preserved
in the British Museum.

‘² Knives were ‘frequently given to the novices and others as presents ' (Fowler, Durh.
Account Rolls [Surt. Soe.] ΙΙΙ, 909), In the Durham·hostiler's rolls (ibid, Ι, 128) occur
entries of boots‚ gloves, knives‚ etc., given out of his office to monks.
