DORCHESTER ABBEY‚ 1445 82

Also the same Ralph entices the young canons to go out of the
cloister precincts for mischievous and lawless games, and causes them to
rebel against the prior and the rest of the elders.

Also he says that there will never be quiet in the monastery so long
as the said Ralph stays in the same.

On and in the which day and place, to wit, on the 24th day of May
in the said chapter-house, the said reverend father, sitting in his capacity
of judge in the business of such his visitation, did publish the matters
discovered [in the same]. And he charged the said John Clyftone with
his guilt with Margaret T ylere‚ and he denied it and cleared himself of
the same with the abbot and other three brethren.

My lord enJ'oined upon the abbot in virtue of obedience that he
should cause the door which opens out of Clyftone's chamber towards
the garden on the north1 to be blocked up within the month.

All the disclosures concerning Ralph Carnelle are respited till Wed-
nesday next after the feast of All Saints [next] to come² ; and the same
Ralph was enjoined that [this side] the feast of St. Michael he should
make provision for himself concerning another place of the same or a
more strict order whereunto he may transfer himself : otherwise my
lord will make provision whither he shall be transferred.

And, after these things had been done thus, my lord, saving his

Also³ against his own will and though Ι was unwilling, he put me to
serve the cure in the town of Stadhampton‚ aud after I had been defamed
there by some that had a spite against me, I received purgatiori with
fifteen others to help me. ’

Α150 in the second week of Lent he smote me very sorely in my face
with his hand and with his staff on my head, so that I shed blood. and
that night he put me in prison in a chamber without bread and drink.

Also one night, when I was on my way to a house where there was
beer for sale, with my manservant after me, carrying a staff in his hand
and a pair of knives at his belt, there suddenly fell upon me six men and
wounded me almost to death and did beat my man very grievously.
On the morrow my master sent after me with his men, who were well
armed, and without mercy, setting aside all manner of good will, he
imprisoned me in chains and bound me with a weight of iron twenty
days ; and in those days I never had a good meal, being put on bread
and water of F ridayS, [and] never [was I] shaved but once. The goods
which Ι had Ι have lost by means of him and his men, and he would
never have had me go free, were it not that I gave him my word that I
would leave the house. And this he desires in special and all these
things I bear because at his election I was against him. Wherefore,
grovelling in lowliness at your holiness' feet, Ι beseech your holiness'
clemency that you will deign to refrain his harshness to me and the rest
of his brethren and would be willing to grant me grace to go to the
university. (He was almost killed together with a novice and violent

verbatim by one of the bishop’s clerks, which accounts for the inti-usion oi a note in the

text without the least indication of the change of person.
