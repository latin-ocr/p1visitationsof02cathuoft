DORCHESTER ABBEY, 1441 71

θ’ of the blessed Mary until Michaelmasl ; and he abjured his sin and the

fellowship of the woman.

The abbot confesses that he did put in pawn a cover of pure gold
for a cup and divers other jewels of the house, without the knowledge
and without asking leave of the convent.

My lord adjourned this visitation until the morrow of the feast of

St. Luke the evangelist next to come,2 and to any day this side thereos
-52 whereon my lord is at leisure to take order for further process in the

same visitation ; and he appointed the abbot such term for shewing the

full stazte [of the house]‚ etc., Depyng, T horpe and I Colstone being
presen .

The same abbot commits adultery with (1) Joan Baroun, with whom

⁴ he was taken in manner suspect in the steward’s chamber⁸ ; (2) the Wife

of John Forde ; (3) the wife of John Roehe ; (4) the wife of John Prest;
(5) the wife of Thomas Fisher3 and all these he maintains upon the
common goods of the house, and so by pawning, nay more truly, as it is
feared, by selling the Jewels of the house he dilapidates and wastes all
the goods of the house. He comes not to quire for the canonical hours
by day or night, nor comes he to chapter to correct transgressions ; and
by his improvident governance the house is more than g 200 in debt.
The canons do not keep cloister any day after breakfast, but some
do spend their time in hawking, some in hunting, some in the public
tavernS, drinking and eating in the same with suspect persons, even with

, low women, to the great scandal of the house.

On the first day of the month of June in the year of our Lord 1441,
at the term, to wit, opportunely taken by my lord, according to the form
of the adjournment of such visitation, for proceeding to further action in

ἦ x the same visitation and the business of the same in agreement with the

 

form of the past process held in the same busineSS, and defined and pre-
appointed by his letters of summons to the lord abbot and the convent,
there appeared in the chapter-house of the said monastery before my
lord, as he was sitting in his capacity of judge in the same business,
brothers John Clyftone the abbot, John Hakeburne the prior, John
Henrethe, Thomas Tewkesbury, Walter Dorcacestre, John Shroesbury,
Ralph Calathra, and Henry Yorke, canons of the said house, summoned
to proceed and watch the process in the said busineSS, brother John
Wyncliestre, late the abbot, who is feehle in body, and brothers Thomas
Henrethe and Walter⁴ Plymmouthe, the which two had departed in
apostasy since the beginning of such visitation, being absent. And then
my lord rehearsed to the abbot after what manner he enjoined upon the
same abbot, while the same my lord, when last he began his visitation in
that place, was proceeding in accordance with his preparatory inquiry
which he then made, that he should shew to him at the term to which
he adjourned such his visitation the full state of the house in the which
it then was and in the which he found the same at the time of his

λζ» , installation ; and how since such injunction the same abbot sent my lord

under his seal a roll containing the values of the manors and churches
appropriated to the monastery.5 But in that it did not contain thie1 fttlillss
