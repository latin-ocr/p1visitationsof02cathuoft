Frater Ricardus Fressheney, prior, dicit quod omnia bene.

Frater Ricardus Croylande dicit quod omnia bene.

Frater Johannes Frestone senior dicit quod omnia bene.

Frater Johannes Botheby dicit quod expediens foret pro religione et
commodo domus de Frestone quod prior illius loci ibidem continue
super cura dicte domus ; nam pronunc expectat prior illius loci in mon-
asterio, propter quod grauiter timetur de magna iactura illius domus ob
absenciam dicti prioris tam in spiritualibus quam in temporalibus.

Item dicitquod elemosinarius duos competentes et magister operis
monasterii alios duos competentes equos exhiberent monachis aliis alia
officia extrinseca occupantibus, ad superuidendum tenementa et posses-
siones huiusmodi officia minora contingencia equitaturis ; etiam deficiunt
huiusmodi equi, propter quod et defectum superuisionis huiusmodi1
tenementa et possessiones huiusmodi ruine patent. Petit igitur, vt
remedium in hoc apponatur.

Item dicit quod in officio elemosinarie est quedam domus que
vocatur ly systere house, vbi ex dudum consueta consuetudine recipie-
bantur et alebantur parentes monachorum et seruientes monasterii, cum

dictine hostel at Cambridge. Of the other names, Brantingham‚ in the East riding of
Yorkshire, was part of the patrimony of the cathedral priory οἱ Durham, and Henry Mel·
tone may probably have come from the village of Melton in the adjoining parish of Wehon,
also a possession of the same monastery. The church of Brantingham was appropriated to
the Benedictine Durham college at Oxford. while that of Welton had belonged to Durham
till 1439, when the Nevilles of Raby obtained its appropriation to their chantry in Lin-
coln minster. The name of Leycestre speaks for itself. Cotgrave is in Nottinghamshire‚
but had some connexion with Lincolnshire‚ owing to the fact that the Cistercian abbot and
convent of Swineshead had the presentation to one of the medieties of the church. The
remaining twenty-five monks‚ except Peylonde‚ who came from Peakirk‚ just across the
border of Northamptonshire‚ bore Lincolnshire names, all from the southern and south-
eastern parts of the county. Four were from Croyland itself‚ two from Frieston, four from
Swineshead‚ two from Benington, three from Mouhon, and one from Leverton‚ all in the
parts of Holland. Boothby‚ either Boothby Graffoe or Boothby Pagnell, [ngoldsby‚ of
which the advowson belonged to Croyland, stamford and Washingborough, are in Kesteven.
Coningsby‚ Huttoft and Burgh are in Lindsey, but in that part which is nearest to the
parts, Οὴξιιξιῖἳνίὶιῗιῖιᾴ cancelled.

¹ The visitation of Bardney in 1437-8 (see p. 16 above) has illustrated the obligation of
Benedictine monasteries with more than twenty members to maintain students at a university.
At Oxford Benedictine students had been provided for at Gloucester and Durham colleges
towards the close of the thirteenth century, archbishop Islip had founded Canterbury college
in 1362, and recently. in 1437, archbishop Chichele had founded St. Bernard’s college for
Cistercians (see Visitations, 1, 155, 159). At Cambridge there was no such regular provision
until 1428. As a consequence of the monastic reforms of Benedict XII, the cathedral priory
of Ely established a hostel at Cambridge in 1340 ; but this was acquired in 1347 by bishop
Bateman of N orwich as part of the site of Trinity hall. Monks from Norwich. St. Benet’s
llulme, and other Norfolk monasteries, appear to have been maintained from time to time
at the Norfolk foundations of Gonville hall and Trinity hall 3 but Benedictine students, in-
cluding those from Croyland, were lodged as a rule with lay-folk in the town, their discipline
being under charge of a censor known as the prior of the studentS. In 1423 and 1426 a
remedy for this condition of things was requested at the Benedictine chapters held at North-
arnpton, and on 7 July‚ 1428. on the petition of abbot Litlyngton and his convent, royal
ι licence was granted to bishop Langley of Durham, bishop Alnwiek‚ then of Noiwich, and
