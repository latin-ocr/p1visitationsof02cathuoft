Now, when these had been examined and questioned, the same
reverend father adjourned such his visitation in the condition wherein it
then was until the morrow, Depyng and Thorpe being present. At the
which term in the said chapel, as it were in the chapter-house of the said
college, the said reverend father, sitting as a tribunal in the business of
such his visitation, when the master and fellows aforesaid, save the pre-
centor, appeared before him, published the depositions of those that had
been examined and questioned in the said business of the visitation.
And then he charged sirs Richard Assheby, John T[oune and] Thomas
Nortone with guilt and familiar intercourse with the women with whom
they are named in the disclosureS, and they cleared themselves of them,
as in the acts abovesaid. And at length the same reverend father warn-
ed the same sirs Richard, J[ohn and Thomas] by his authority as ordin-
ary and by the authority of the statutes of the said college, and each one
of thern by himself severally, a first, second and third time peremptorily,
under the penalties passed in the constitutions ⁴ Licet ad profugandum ’,
eto, and ‘Quia’,1 and under the penalty specified and expressed in the
sworn statutes of the said college, to refrain themselves henceforward
from the said women and from all familiar intercourse in their or other
folks' houses for the future; and to have recourse in no wise to their
houses or those of other folk with the same women, or even to the public
taverns in the said town beyond the [special] cases and restrictions of
the constitutions and statutes aforesaid.² And then, the aforesaid John
Redburne having been charged with defaming the college and the
several persons of the same defamed by him, and with having taken off
the [victua]ls of the college and consumed them in his own house, the
same John denies all these things expressly, offering himself in readiness
to clear his innocence as regards each of the premises, even as my lord
shall determine to appoint. When therefore the master and fellows
aforesaid had been asked by the same reverend father if [they had] any
proofs against the same John, who for that time by my lord's command
was absent from the said chapel, sir John P[uttenham] named to the said
reverend father certain persons whose names are written above, by
means of whom, as he averred, if they be examined, the truth may ap-
pear. Wherefore, after the aforesaid persons had been brought forward
before the said reverend father in the said chapel, in the presence of the
§aid John Redburne, being then present, and had been sworn in the form
of witnesses who are to be sworn, tha-‚same reverend father proceeded
to their examination and examined th'ssem severally [touching] the said
defamation a'nd consumption and taking-off of victuals. And of these
