INTRODUCTION lvii

In October, 1440, the prioress was Elizabeth Weldon ι there were eight
, nuns and three novices. On fast-days—or, as one nun said only in
Advent and Lent—-the convent took its meals in the frater, on other days
in the prioress’ hall; but the sub-prioress had adopted the wasteful habit,
often found in mediaeval nunneries, of keeping a separate table, in this
case for herself, one nun and a novice. The prioress confessed that she
had never rendered an account z the nunnery was poor and somewhat'in
debt, the nuns had no allowance for their habits, and the frater was out
of repair, but the most serious complaint which any nun had to bring
upon the head of mismanagement was that the temporalities of the'house
were not properly attended to. Apart from this, the nuns were allowed
too much freedom : one of them went to stay for a week with her father
at Thornhaugh, while another, who in times past had left the priory for
a day and a night in the company of an Austin friar, had eloped eighteen
months before with a harper to Newcastle-on-Tyne.

The bishop's injunctions, founded very closely upon the detecta,
were delivered verbally before he left the convent and were expanded
into a written series. Their main points were the obligation of closer
supervision on the part of the prioress, the necessity of increased
economy, and the prohibition of communication with secular folk. In
June, 1442, however, the prioress, when asked if she had kept the
injunctions and enforced their observance, pleaded guilty to a certain
amount of negligence. Her excuse was that her health did not allow of
her constant attendance in church, cloister and frater, and she alleged
that the bishop had given her a dispensation, which he denied. Further
examination showed that, if the injunctions had been observed at all, it
was difficult to point to one which had been duly regarded. Free
communication with seculars still prevailed. A married man had been
allowed to board with his wife in the priory, and a nun had had a child
by him. No injunctions were delivered after the visitation, but the
prioress was suspended from all active part in the management of affairs,
&ich was put into the hands of Margaret Mortymer and Alice

yteryng.

In August, 1445, a third visitation was entrusted to Alnwick’s
chancellor, John Depyng. Things were no better than before. Margaret
Mortymer had fallen into carnal sin, and Alice Wyteryng was managing
the convent with an unauthorised assistant and confessed that she
neither made nor rendered accounts. The prioress complained that the
nuns disobeyed her, while the nuns agreed that the prioress was
incapable. The visitation was adjourned until the following February,

unprofitable rule came to an end.

· From these examples it is obvious that the exercise of episcopal
control was difficult, especially in the case of small houses such as St.
Michael’s. Peterborough was a large and important monastery, much
in the public eye. Among its monks were able men of affairs, and

convent at the time of this visitation from P. Rg. Ministers’ accounts 1²60l19· The
convent owed {22 14s. 2d. as against [20 Is. 9d. due to it from various sources. Its largest
debtor was the bishop’s registrar, Thomas Colstone, who owed ,67 Ios. od., possibly in
respect of the priory’s rents at Corby, Lines.9 where he had his abode.
