HUNTINGDON PRIORY‚ 1439 149

excellent master Thomas Duffelde‚ bachelor in divinity‚ after this text,
⁶ Thou shalt visit thy brethren to see if they fare aright, and learn with
what men they are set in array.' And when this was brought to an end
in the Latin tongue, the prior delivered to the same reverend father the
certificate of my lord’s mandate which had been addressed to the same
prior for such visitation, sealed with the seal of his office. The which
having been read through at the commandment of the said reverend
father, and the prior having been called by name and making his appear-
ance, the same prior, in lieu os the foundation charter ot that priory,
shewed a bull of [pope] Anastasius in confirmation of all the possessions
of the place² ; also a book called the martyrology,² wherein note is made
of one William Lovethoftes, who was then the true patron ot that place.⁸
He exhibits also by way of his title the certificate of the collation
made to him by my lord of Canterbury, by the right lapsed to him, at
the time of the voidance of the see of Lincoln, and the letter of his
installation by the official of the archdeacon of Huntingdon.⁴ He does
not shew the state ot' the house, because it is in the hands of his counsel.
They are not bound to the observation of any chantries whatsoever:
therefore he shews no [ordinance therefor]. He exhibits also the
injunctions made by the lord William, of late bishop of Lincoln,⁵ but he
left no copies of the [documents] exhibited in the hands of the registrar.

in the form accustomed, and then upon examination he says these things
which follow.

Brother John Madyngley,⁶ the prior, says that brother John Rysshe-
ton, canon, albeit he is stout and capable enough at table and at song,⁷
refuses, even when warned and bidden, to celebrate sung masses accord-
ing to the custom of the place, as the others do in their season. He
asserts that by reason os: bodily weaknesses his voice is out of order, and
touching this he proffered his oath. Howbeit it is my lord's will that he
make trial whether he can celebrate with music. If he should be ableto
do so without bodily harm, well and g00d; otherwise, if by reason of
this he should run risk of grievous infirmity, let him abstain.

The same brother John Rysshetone, warden of the new chapel of
blessed Mary at the west side of the church, keeps the keys of the box
in the same‘3 and disposes at his pleasure of the monies that proceed from
that box, whereas the custom was that such money should be laid out to
the advantage οἱ the house by survey of the prior and convent and with
their consent. He confesses that he has the key : he was warned, how-
ever, to deliver the key to the sub-prior ; and, when [the box] should

⁶ The names of the canons, with the exceptions of Heresord (which may, however,
be Hartford, anciently Hareford‚ near Huntingdon) and Cressyngham‚ come from places at
no great distance from Huntingdon. Great and Little Cressingham are in Norfolk‚ near
Watton. Madingley is west of Cambridge, about twelve miles from Huntingdon. St.
Ives and Overton (Orton Longueville or Orton Waterville) are in Hunts. Etone is
probably Eaton Socon, Beds., near St. Neots. Castre (Castor) is in Northants‚ close to
the Huntingdonshire bo'rder. Rysshetone is Rushton, Northants„ near Kettering‚ and
Oclee may be either Greaz or Little Oakley, not far from the same neighbourhood.

of the nave near the west end of the church.
