regularity with which they dragged their slow length along, we are in an
impersonal atmosphere of officialdom, where all -is done by rote. The
one thing that can be said is that the bishop and his assistants
were ready to live laborious days. Of contemporary judgments upon
him we have next to none, and the rhetorical monk of Bury is a
prejudiced witness.1 The testimony of Gascoigne‚ who refers to him
twice, is purely negative, but Gascoigne's constantly expressed dislike
for Pecok's opinions would have been in sympathy with Alnwick's action
against Pecok's diseiple2, and, in his reference to the dispute between
Alnwick and dean Macworth and the opportunity which it gave for
appeals to Rome, it was the decanus superbuS, and not the bishop, whom
he appears to regar-d as the source of the abundant evils which were the
result of the controversy.3 At any rate, the constant attention which
Alnwick showed to his diocesan work separates him from the category
of prelates condemned by Gascoig'ne as being so busy for their
own advantage at court that their dioceses and the realm suffered
equally.⁴1

In the first volume of Visitations of Religious H ouses a general account
of the process of visitation was given.⁵ This need not be repeated, as
the documents before us give detailed information with regard to its
general conduct, and there are few which do not begin with the
stereotyped narrative of the opening session, the sermon, the exhibitiou
of the certificate required by the bishop's mandate, the oath of obedience
and the production of the title-deeds of his house and of his own
incumbency by i'ts head. without, therefore, directly describing the
visitation itself, we may inquire what relation our present documents
bear to the successive stages of procedure through which it passed.

In the first place, what are these documents ? When and how were
they composed ? It will be noticed that they differ considerably in the
quantity and arrangement of their contents. For example, the Bardney
document of 1437-8 (no. 11) and the Peterborough document of 1437
(no. LV111) open with a very full and lengthy summary, covering in each
case the whole of one side of a leaf, of the entire procedure of each
visitation until the prorogation of the first and the adjournment of the
second. The remainder of the Bardney document is occupied with the
depositions of the various monks made during the preparatory inquiry ε ’
for everything else we must look to the opening statement. In the case of
Peterborough the same method of reporting is pursued : the only
variations are that a schedule detailing the prior's complaints has been
preserved and that there occurs at the end a reference to injunctions
which no longer exist. One interesting feature, however, which should
be noticed is that at Peterborough, where the task of examining a large
