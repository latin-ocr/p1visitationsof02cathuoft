CANONS ASHBY PRIORY, 1442 46

William Bulkley‚ baker, dwells within the priory, having with him
his young wife. The woman is more skilful in that art than the man, and
therefore so abides 3 and they shall stay only until Michaelmas next.

Six women in the year gone by did stay and lie anight within the
priory. Two are old women : the rest were [there] in the autumn
season1 and no longer.

And then, after reserving the power of making and enjoining man-

* dates and injunctions in keeping with the disclosures,'·' my lord dissolved

the visitation.

THE v1S1TAT1oN OF THE PRIORY OF THE NUNs oF CATESBY, OF THE
ORDER OF CiTEAux‚ OF THE DIOCESE or LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN
THE CHAP‘rER-HOUSE THERE ON THE 17TH DAY oE THE MONTH OF

IN chsT AND LORD, THE LoRD W1LL1AM, BY THE GRACE or
Gon BISHOP or L1NcoLN‚ IN THE 16TH YEAR oF H1s CONSECRATION
AND THE s1XTH oF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge as a tribunal in the business of the said visitation on and
in the day and place aforesaid, there appeared before him the prioress
and convent of the aforesaid place, in readiness, as was apparent, to under·
go such visitation ; and then, first and before all else, the word of God
was set forth in accordance with the process that was to take place and
the company that heard it, in the vulgar tongue by the honourable master
John Beverley, professor of holy writ,³ after this text, ‘ Go forth, ye
daughters of Syon, and behold king Solomon,’ etc. And when this was
done, the prioress delivered to my lord the certificate of the mandate
[which had been addressed] to her for the beginning of such visitation,
after these words, ‘To the reverend father in Christ,' etc. The which
having been read through, the prioress shewed her title⁴ and a bull con—
firmative of the foundation,⁵ and swore obedience and fealty. And then
the same reverend father proceeded to his preparatory inquiry in the
following manner.

Sister Margaret Wavere says that sister A[gnes Allesl] ey has six or
seven young folk of both sexes that do lie in the dorter.

[Also she says] that secular folk have often recourse to the nuns’
chambers within the cloister, and talkings and junketings take place
there without the knowledge of [the prioress]

[Also] she says that she herself has four nuns in her household, and
there are three other households of nuns within the cloister.6

⁶ The confirmatory bull of Gregory IX, dated 15 Nov., 1231, is printed in Monasticon,
lv, 637-8. It confirmed to the priory the appropriated churches of Catesby and Hellidon
Northants., and Ashby magna, Leices., with the manors of Ashby magna, and of Bassord ixi
Nottinghamshire. These, with the church of Bassord‚ formed the endowment given by the
founder, Robert son of Philip, otherwise called Robert Esseby (zze. of Ashby). Vicarages
were ordained in all four churches: see Rotuli Hug. Welles (Cant. and York Soc.)‚ 1, 209,
