several persons of the said monastery that now are and shall be, under
pain of imprisonment for half the year immediately following, so often as
anyone of you shall transgress herein, that you do in no wise whatsoever
pawn, sell or alienate the crosseS, chalices, bookS, vestments, jewels or
other utensils, by what name soever they be esteemed, that belong to the
monastery or to any special office thereos, without the consent of the
convent; and that you do bring back to the monastery those that are
now in pawn and completely restore those that have been alienated and
sold to the same monastery within one year immediately following upon
the day of receipt of these presents.

Also, inasmuch as according to the truth of the gospel, the heir, so
long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord
οἱ all, we will, ordain and enjoin under the penalties written above and
beneath, that to the young canons who have not attained the condition
of priesthood certain other canons of riper age and discretion be assigned
and appointed as care-takers‚ who, and not the youths themselveS, shall
have the guardianship and disposal of the private allowance of the same

render a reckoning of their administration before the abbot². ’

Also we enjoin upon you the abbot and every one that shall succeed
you, in virtue of obedience and under pain of contempt and the excom-
munication written beneath, that once in every week, if you be present
in the monastery and shall have convenient leisure, you be present in
person at the celebration of chapter and do correct the transgressions,
guilts and defaults of offending canons with fatherly kindness accord-
ing to the rule, in such wise that not their freedom from punishment,
but their penalty, may be an abiding example to all, and that you
do use the quire more often at the times of the canonical hours and rest
in the dorter of a night, and do keep more careful watch that your
brethren observe without breach these our injunctions and commands,
and do bear yourself on such wise in your behaviour as regards God and
men, that by the example of an honest life and by the savour of good
report you may be able to keep and encourage them that are set under
you in the path of pure religion without blame.³

[We enjoin] moreover upon you the abbot, etc., as in the injunctions
for the ⁴monastery of blessed Mary of the meadows of Leicester, up to
the end.

And because we manifestly found, not only by our preparatory
inquiry which we then made, but also by the sight of our eyes, that your
said monastery, by the improvident governance of certain presidents of
the same, is in manifold wise brought so low by debt and by the ruinous
condition of the houses and buildings oi the said monastery both within
and without, that, such burthen and ruinous condition considered, it
shall in likelihood go its way to naught, therefore, by the express consent,
assent and prayer of you all, we ordain‚ establish and appoint William
Marmyone administrator of the temporal affairs of the said monastery,
to receive and administer all the commodities of such things temporal,

 

³ The comperta with regard to the abbot's conduct made this injunction necessary. .

4 The elaborate injunctions for Leicester abbey had been issued from Liddington in
Dec„ 1440, and their common forms were probably referred to in this case, as applymg to
an abbey of Austin canons. The matter of the postscript which follows has already been
summarised in the conclusion of the process of the visitation-
