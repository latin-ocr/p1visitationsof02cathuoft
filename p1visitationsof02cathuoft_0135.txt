BARDNEY ABBEY, 1440 30

Waynflete and Hole talking together in the chapter-house, but he did
not understand them, and immediately after this Waynflete and Lang-
tofte went to their beds, and the other two entered the church and went
about from altar to altar and gathered up the eandm-ends, and thereafter,
having shut the church door, they went into the sacristy hard by the
said door¹; and, when they had closed that door, this deponent saw
through a chink the said Hole and Lincolne seal a blank parchment or
empty sheet with the common seal acl causa&

Interrogated further concerning the abbot's governance, he says
that he reckons him a good priest towards God, but yet he is not wary
in temporal matters, nor will the monastery prosper under his govern-
ance, for that the manors and grangeS, especially at Steeping, are utterly
in deca .

Βῑέῒ116ι· Thomas Bartone, being sworn and interrogated touching
the sealing abovesaid, says that he knows not but of this one blank
parchment only, which yesterday early in the morning was scaled that

Also he says that brother John Bracy is not profitable but faithless
in making out his accounts in the office of kitchener which he holds, and
this he espied in his accounts, Bracy himself being unable to deny it.

Brother William Langtofte, one of the keepers of the common
seal. being sworn and examined touching matters concerning the house,
says that on Wednesday directly after matins the abbot sent the key of
the custody of the seal by Henry Lincolne to this Langtofte and William
Waynflete, and so this Langtoft delivered his own key to the said Lin-
colne, and so the same Lincolne and Hole sealed such¹ a blank sheet to
’ draw up a proxy. He does not know, however, whether Waynflete, the
third keeper of the common seal, was present at the time of the sealing
or not. But he says that Hole was present.

Brother William Croyland, likewise sworn and examined, says
plainly that he does not know of any such sealing. And he says that the
abbot is of no great account in temporal matters.

Brother William Waynflete, the sub-prior, likewise sworn and in·
terrogated, says that he was present at the treaty in the chapter-house,
and says that all the three keys of the custody of the seal are . . . .‚ to
wit, that of the abbot, which the abbot sent by Lincolne, while Langtofte
handed over his key to the same [Lincolne], and this deponent handed
to the same Lincolne his own key, and so Lincolne and Hole scaled a
blank parchment to draw up a proxy, and because there was no-one in
the monastery who knew how to write a proxy, therefore they sent that
blank sheet thus sealed to Lincoln to be written on.2

 

proceedings. When Hole and Lincolne came into the church, they collected the candle·
ends to give colour, in case they were watched, to their use os the sacristy at that untimely
honr. After this, feeling sase from detection, they shut the church-door, and went into the
sacristy‚ closing the door of that also. It was through a chink of the sacristy door that
Bracy watched the sealing. There is a difficulty in the description of the sacristy as ‘hard
by the church door,’ unless the western part of the south transept or part of the south aisle
of the nave were partitioned off for this purpose. The building of which foundations have
been discovered south of the south aisle of the presbytery answers more nearly to a con-
venient position for the sacristy, the position of which, however, varied considerably in
Benedictine churches.
