such his visitation; and then first and before all else the word of God
was set forth by the excellent master John Beverley, professor of holy
writ,¹ after this text, ‘Present your members a living sacrifice, a holy
sacrifice, a sacrifice acceptable to God.’ And when this was come to a
praiseworthy end in the vulgar tongue, the prioress of the said place,

‚ being asked for her certificate of my lord's mandate, says that she

received my lord’s mandate on the feast of St. Denis last.² Interrogated
whether she has a certificate touching the execution thereof, she says no,
because she did not understand it, nor did her chaplain also to whom

she renders her account to ¹her sisters yearly, she says no: she sayS,

prioress on examination says these things which follow.

Darne Margaret Pole,⁷ the prioress, says with respect to the
revenues of the house that they had at Dalby⁸ ten marks and twenty
quarters of wheat, and now they have only a hundred shillings. They
were wont to have ten pounds at Somerby, and now they have nine
pounds. They were wont to have a hundred shillings at Diseworth,
and now they have only twenty-four shillings. At Barkby they were
wont to have six pounds in temporalitieS, and now they have only four
pounds. At Belgrave forty shillings: now they have nothing, because
nothing is known of the lands wherefrom they should be levied. And
they have forty shillings from the rent of a water mill, and twenty
