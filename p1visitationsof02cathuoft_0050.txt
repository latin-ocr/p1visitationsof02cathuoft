xlii INTRODUCTION

12-22, Buckden¹ ; 25, Sleaford ; 26-29, Nettleham and Lincoln. October z
2, Sleaford ; 6, Ramsey ; 7-30, Buckden. November : 12, 14, Buckden;
16-29, Liddington. December affords on the 1st and 2nd a good
illustration of double dating, as documents occur from Liddington and
Sleaford on both days. The remainder of December is somewhat
uncertain : 5, Liddington ; 7, Liddington and Buckden ; 12, Daventry ;
16, Liddington ; 20-29, Sleaford, which was thus again chosen for
ChristmaS.

Beginning with January, 1447-8, the evidence becomes scanty and dull.
The records of visitations have by this time ceased, with the exception of
one from Nutley, οἱ which the date, possibly January 1447-8, is doubtful.
The fragmentary consistory court-book, which belongs to the later period

of Alnwick's rule, contains very little of his personal doings, as the bulk ·

of the work was delegated to commissaries. A summary of dates follows.

January, 1447-8 : 9, Liddington ; 10, Leighton Buzzard (one of those
useful dates which can be direetly referred to thebishop’s doings);
11-21, Wooburn; 29, Liddington (non-personal) and Cambridge3 31,
Huntin don.

Fegruary, 1447-8 z 2-13, Sleaford ; 2ο, Liddington (non-personal)
and Lincoln ; 21-26, Nettleham and Lincoln 3 29, Sleaford.

March, 1447—8 ι All dates, Nettleham and Lincoln.

April, 1448 : 3, 4, Lincoln ; 12, Stamford and London ; 23, Lincoln;
24, Sleaford; 29, Nettleham. Whether the bishop went personally to
London is hard to decide. If he did he probably stayed there till June.

May, 1448. The dates are again contradictory: 1, Lond0n; 3,
Liddington 3 5, 6, Sleaford ; 13, 16, London ; 18, Sleaford ; 2ο, London ;
27, Liddington ; 30, 31, London.

June, 1448, is equally hard to explain satisfactorily : 2-15, London ;
21, Liddingt0n; 22-27, Sleaford; 30, Liddington. The July dates make
it probable that Alnwick was at Sleaford at the end of June ; but, before
the 215t at any rate, he may have been in London.

July, 1448 : 2-15, Sleaford3 11, ⁸ Ketelby,' which may be identified
with more than one place in north Lincolnshire ; 24, 26, N ettleham and
Lincoln ; 27, Sleaford ; 30, Liddington.

August, 1448 : 1-16, Liddington 3 2'2, 23, Tharne 3 31, London.

September, 1448 : 2, London; 7, 11, Liddington ; 13-21, Buckden ;
24, Liddington ; 25, Buckden 3 29, Liddington.

October, 1448 : 3-6, Liddington 3 13, Sleaford; 18-20, Lincoln ; 29,
Liddington (probably non-personal).

November, 1448 : all dates Lincoln and Nettleham.

December, 1448: 3, 5, Lincoln, Nettleham; 8-22, Sleaford.
Ldeamgary, 1448-9: 8, Sleaford3 9, Kettering3 20, 24, Buckden; 28,

1 mg on.

February, 1448-9: 1-9, Sleaford; 13, Sleaford and Lincoln; 14,
Lincoln and Brigg ; 16-24, Sleaford.

March, 1448-9 ; 4, Liddington ; 7-12, Buckden 3 16, Nettleham
(non-personal) and London ; 19, Liddington <non-personal) 3 21, London ;
26 March, 1449, London ; 29, Eton.

April, 1449 : 4, Liddington ; 8, Sleaford 3 10, 19, Lincoln 3 23,
Sleaford ; 25, Lincoln 3 27, 28, Liddington.

¹ There appears, however, to have been a visitation of Bardney on 19 Sept. (seenote 2
on p. 34 below), which would invalidate Buckden for some days before 22 Sept.
