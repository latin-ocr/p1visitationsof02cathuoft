LEICESTER, NEW COLLEGE, 1440 193

the vicars' commons ; and the precentor was enJ'oined to mark their
defaults and cause the penalties to be levied himself. (Kempsale.
Injunction to all in common and to the precentor.)

(Note.) Sir Richard Spurnere,¹ the dean's vicar, made sufficient
exhibition and sware obedience ; and he says upon examination that sir
John Bramburghe, canon, ostentimes admits an'd receives into his lodging
which he has as canon women suspect and os cheap reputation, even
such as are esteemed to be common harlots. (Bramburghe.)

Also he says that certain of the canons, who for their absences from
quire should pay twenty pence or more, pay hardly twopence, and there-
fore they are made more ready to withhold their presence, and this
altogether contrary to the statutes. (Penalty for absence.)

(Note. 14.) Also he says that according to the statutes of the church²
the gate-keeper should go in front of the processions of the church and
him who performs the office, as they enter and leave quire, with his staff
in his hand3 and now on Wednesdays and Fridays, when processions
are made in the church, he withholds his presence and betakes himself
to his marketings in buying and selling fish.³ (The gate·keeper. Injunc-
tion.

(Note. 15.) Also he says that the same gate-keeper's wife sells beer
within the gates of the close, to the which place flock together the
canons, vicars and chaplains⁴ of the church, and sit there until eight,
nine or ten o’clock after noon; and this, if it be kept up, shall breed
grievous scandal to the college. (The gatekeeper's wife.)

Also he says that Simon Simeon⁵ founded three chantries in the
college, which are served by the vicars, for the which charge the same
vicars should receive twenty pounds yearly; and now the canons take
away seven pounds from the same vicars. (Simeon's chantrieS. Note z
let my lord be consulted touching this.)

Also he says that in the almshouse there are some who are well able
to seek their living with their hands, and they are not sent away accord-
ing to the statutes when they are sound, albeit they have been taken in
for their infirmities ; but they even work for their hire with the canons
apd others in the town and so pocket money and grow to riches. (The
a monr .)

(Ngte. 16.) Also he says that certain rents in the town of Leicester
are given to the college for the celebration of certain obits in the college,
which are kept and yet the monies are not received, because the sister’s
husband of Fysshewyk, the provost, is the collector of such rents, and
there is none who dares speak a word to him concerning such matter.
It has been ordained by consent that such rent for the space of three
years should be laid out in the repair of the tenements⁶ for the space of
three yearS, which is not yet finished. (Rent in Leicester. Injunction.)

Also note should be made of the seventy-first statute⁷ touching the
praymlent (fif tegiltllils azrael tthe {ather payments in respect of the businesses of

question is the 8811] paragraph of the original statum, the 77th in the revision ; but some
of the earlier paragraph5‚ as appears from a comparison of Russell's subsequent revision
with the references given in Atwater‘s and Longland's visitaticns, were evidently combined
as single statutes. The numbering given here doubtless corresponds to that of the copy
kept in the college. The statute provided that tenths payable to the pope, king, nuncio,
legate. etc.. and other extraordinary burdens or travelling expenses incurred on their
account by the dean or any canon, should be paid by the provost out of the common goods.
