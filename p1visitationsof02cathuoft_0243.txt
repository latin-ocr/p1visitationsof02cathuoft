DUNsTABLE PRIORY, 1442-3 8 5·

,Α , canonical hours at the due time, but delay too long after the bells have

been run .

(Thegprior.) The cook of the house is overmuch puffed up and
surly, nor does he favour the canons alike‚ and he differs from the canons
in nau ht.

(Ggodefrey.) Brother Robert Pavenham says that brother John
Godefrey does not come to the divine office in quire or give his time
to religion, but goes a hunting and is almost a law to himself. He was
warned to be present at matins and high mass on Sundays and high-days

(Godefrey.) The same John Godefrey keeps and for three years’
space has kept from the said Pavenham the monies which should be dis-
tributed according to the ordinance made by my lord in that place.² Let
‚ the books of expense be looked to.

(The prior.) Brother John Londone says that the infirm [canons]
have no one to do service to them in their seasons of ill-health.

(The prior.) Also if there be aught betwixt a canon and a secular‚
the prior favours the secular rather than the canon.

(The prior.) Also that the ordinance made by my lord for the

governance of the house is in default of the prior unknown to several ·

who since have entered religion ; wherefore they are afraid that they are
transgressing against the ordinance.

(The prior.) Also that the chamber wherein the canons eat is too
narrow for themselves and the serving-folk.

(The prior.) Also‚ before new ale is put in cask, the canons are
compelled to clean the vessels.

(All.) Brother John Beaupree says that the young canons do not
come regularly to quire at divine service as the elders do, but spend their
time in idleness and games, and are not busied in meditation or reading
or study outside the time of the hours for divine service, but gad about
everywhere at their will.

(Londone, Oundelle, Godefrey.) Also he says that, since the time of
the ordinance made in the house by my lord, brothers John Londone,
Robert Oundelle and John Godefrey have oftentimes had drink and meat
in the town of Dunstable, contrary to the prohibition in my lord's ordin-
ance. Londone was sworn to fulfil the penance to be enjoined upon
him and to refrain henceforth. He was absolved. Oundelle confesses
that he had so drunken with knowledge of the ordinance, and was sworn
to perform his penance and to refrain henceforth. He was absolved and,
because he is a priest, was pronounced to be irregular in that he has
celebrated [mass]2; and Londone³ and Oundelle were enjoined to fast
on bread and water the next Friday. Godefrey confesses that he had so
eaten and afterwards had celebrated ; and, having taken the accustomed
oath and [sworn] that, while the ordinance lasts, he will not drink in the
town, he was absolved and was enjoined to fast on bread and water on
Tuesday⁴ [and] Friday this side of Easter.

(The prior.) Brother John Rysley [says] that the dorter and cloister
ἓυὶἱει· serious defects in their walls, wherefrom there is fear of their

alling.

(Londone.) Also brother John Londone many times and almost of
custom withholds his presence from matins, and though he is rebuked,
he is no better. The prior was enjoined that, if he transgresses here-
aster, he shall for the first time be punished with [the fine of] a penny,
