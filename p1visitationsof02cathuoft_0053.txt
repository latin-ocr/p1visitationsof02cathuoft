INTRODUCTION xlv

number of monks was divided between the bishop and two of his clerks,
the results of the inquiry made by his chancellor‚ John Depyng, are
reported upon a separate sheet of paper in a handwriting which differs
considerably from the beautiful, if somewhat too minute characters ol
Thomas Colstone.

With this type of document, the feature of which is that the usual
prefatory matter is continued at length as a succinet formal report of the
whole visitation, may be contrasted the long and elaborate visitation of
Fotheringhay college in 1438 (no. xxn). The account of the opening of
the visitation brings us, according to the usual method, to the preparatory
ἕὲιῖΐὲἑξηῖἓὲ ιῗνίρίῗὲᾎῖἓῗ ffssssss‘gsaffdssffssfifissweiss3530?ssss έῗίεῖῗῖε ῗιῖἓ
witnesses to be produced in a special inquiry with regard to the conduct

q of the lay steward of the college. The narrative of the visitation is then

taken up at the close of the preparatory inquiry and continued to the
beginning of the investigation into the steward's behaviour. This long

’. and not unentertaining business concluded, the formal narrative is

pursued as far as the adjournment of the visitation. An entire leaf is
then left blank, save for an irrelevant note scribbled upside down upon
the verso, aud the only matter contained in the leaf which follows is a
mandate committing the adjourned visitation to John Depyng.

A similar document is the long visitation of· Peterborough in 1446
(no. Lx), which proceeds upon the lines of the Fotheringhay document
as far as the end of the depositionS. It then records the special proceed-
ings held against the abbot in a case of defamation, some complementary
evidence with regard to which is recorded in a schedule of three months

x- later, now pasted into the MS. at an earlier leaf. These proceedingS,

which include the adjournment of the visitation from September until
the following February, occupy the foot of a page. On the verso of the
leaf are three separate documentS‚ viz, (1) an account of the prior's
resignation, to which is added a continuation of the business regarding
the abbot ; (2) a set of negligently written memoranda bearing the
evidence already produced : and (3) a report of the continuation of the
adjourned process in February, 1446-7, which finishes in a now almost
illegible passage at the top of an otherwise blank leaf.

It would be confusing to multiply examples, where every document,
apart from the briefest and most featureless (e. g. Chacombe priory, no.
XII), presents certain shades of difference; but those which have been
cited will serve to answer our first question. Each document, in the
first instance, is a summarised report of the depositions made by each
member of each religious house, in the course of a private and separate
examination to which he was submitted in the ‘place of chapter ' of his
monastery or college by the bishop or the bishop's commissary. That
these notes were absolutely taken down from the mouth of each witness
is not very likely : they were written quickly and contain abundance of
cancelled passages, but they are too compressed and brief to have been
made upon the actual spot. But there can be no doubt that they were
composed immediately after the preparatory inquiry or the day's work
was over, as a digest of notes taken while evidence was being given. In
the type of report represented by the Bardney and Peterborough
documents first mentioned, the registrar has proceeded upon a neat and
orderly plan. He has reserved at Peterborough the recto, and at
