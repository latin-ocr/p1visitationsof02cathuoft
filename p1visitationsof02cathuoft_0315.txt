the canonical hours and behaves himself very irreverently at the altar,
for he cleans the stables and goes to the altar with unwashen hands, nor
makes any bow before or after [mass]. He dwelt sometime at Lough-
borough‚ where he was not of good report.

Also sometimes the nuns do help secular folk in garnering their
grain during the autumn season.

(Note). It should be remembered to make mention to the prioress
and all that they receive not any boaders.

Darne Elizabeth Jurdone says that the prioress for twenty-three
years withholds from the office of the infirmary twenty shillings given by
one Knyvyngtonel of the county of Derby.

Also that a Frenchwoman of very unseemly conversation is ‘their

, maltstress.

Also she says that the secular serving-folk hold the nuns in despite :
she prays that they may be restrained ; and chiefly are they rebellious in
their words against the kitohener.

Dame Philippa Jecke says that all corrections are made with so
great harshness and so much ado that charity and loving·kindness are
banished from the house.

Also she says that the infirmary is in such a ruinous state that the
nuns cannot abide there without great discomfort.²

Dame Aliee Rowby says that Belers trusts so highly in her own
judgment that she despises the others.

Dame Agnes Poutrelle says all things are well.

Dame Isabel Jordane says all things are well.
Dame Elizabeth Shirburne says that Poutrelle dubs herself the

prioress’s disciple, and whatever she hears or sees among the nuns she

ν straightway retails to the prioress, who seolds them most shamefully.

Also she says that Isabel Jordane is in the same case.

Darne Margaret Belers, the cellaress.

Dame Margaret Chesham, the sub-cellareSS‚ says that she lies in the
infirmary at the commandment of the prioress and comes not to matins
of a night or to the other houm, and for this cause, that they have
not any serving-woman in the infirmary.

Also she says that the servants of the house come not together, but
in seattered parties and severally to meals to the great waste of the
house, forasmuch as what would be enough for four is set before one or
two. .

Dame Margaret Crosse says that all things are well.

Dame Margaret Gretham refers herself to the words of the sub—
prioress and the others that follow her.

Dame Joan Germeyn says all things are well. ,

Dame Custance Londone says that satisfaction has not been made
her of her raiment.⁸

÷That the prioress is of no use to the house, for by reason of her
incapacity she has renouneed for herself the governanee of things
temporal and pays no heed to religion.

² As Phillippa Jake or Jecke seems from her place in the list of 1418. where she stands
fourth, to have been one of the senior nuns, she was probably spenoing her old age in the
mfirmary and had reason for complaint.

³ The short paragrauhs which follow are the articles drawn up from the detecta against

the prioress and others involved in them.
