THE FIFTH OF H1s TRANSLATmN.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the beginning of the business of such his visitation,
on and in the day, place and year abovesaid, there appeared before him
the prioress and convent of the said place, to undergo, as was apparent,
such his visitation 3 and then first and before all else the word of God
was set forth by the excellent master Thomas Duffelde, bachelor in
divinity, after this text, ‘ Present your bodies a sacrifice to the Lord.'
And when this had come to a praiseworthy end in the vulgar tongue, the
prioress of that place shewed to the said reverend father the certificate
of my lord's mandate which had been addressed and delivered to her for
such visitation, the purport whereof is on such wise, ‘To the right rever·
end‚’ etc. Thereafter she shewed the foundation charter² and the state
of the house, and then she sware obedience in the form accustomed ; but
touching the confirmation of her election⁸ she shewed nothing. After-
wards on examination she says these things which follow.

Dame Alice Dunwyche‚⁴² the prioress, says that at her entry the house
was forty-eight pounds in debt and now it is in debt thirty-eight pounds.

Also she says that frater is not kept, nor has it been kept for seven
years, and that the nuns sit in company with secular folk at table in her
hall every day, and that they have reading during meals.

Also she says that there arevtwo households only in the house, to wit
[in] her hall and the infirmary, where there are three at table together.

or six a S.
th Alslo syhe says that the nuns who are Officers go to the offices by
emse ves.

Also she says that a male child of seven years sleeps in the dorter
with the cellaress.

Also she says that in her time three corrodies have been sold, one to
the vicar of Whitwick⁵ for 2gzo, and another to a donzel⁶ for fifty marks.

remember that, although his picture owes something to a graceful imagination‚ the state of
things in 1418 may have been better than Alnwick found it 22 to 23 years later.

⁴ Alice Dunwyche, Elizabeth Jurdone, Philippa Jecke and Aliee Rowby occur in the list
of nuns in 1418. . In 1440-1 there was one nun less than the fifteen in 1418. The only
Leicestershire place-name among t'ne surnames of the nuns is Romby, ι’. e. Ratby. a few
miles west of Leicester. The family of Belers. however which, gave its name to Kirkby
Bellms, was well known in Leicestershire and Poutrelle is also a local name, while from the
account-book it appears that the Jurdones or Jordanes and the Rowbys or Robys lived at
