LAUND PRIORY, 1440 179

Also he says that scarce in anything is silence kept according to the
rule.

Brother Nicholas Holbeche says that one of the canons of the house
is on business outside it, but with the prior's licence.

Also he says that the chancels of the appropriated churchesl and
several tenements belonging to the priory are in great decay.

Brother William Yarum, the precentor, says as above concerning the
corrodies that have been sold, and [that this has been done] without the
bishop's licence.

Brother Henry Westone says all things are well, save this, that the
common seal is not duly kept, forasmuch as sometimes the sub-prior, and
sometimes the precentor only have for long time together all the keys
under which that seal is kept in their hands ε he prays therefore that this
matter may be reformed, that no damage may befall the house by reason
of this.

Brother Thomas Asfordeby, the sacrist and almoner, says that the
prior renders not a full account yearly at the end of the year, and so the
convent is not certain to what sum the house is in debt.

Also he says as above concerning silence, that it is not kept.

Also he says that the alms which are given for deceased canons are
sometimes assigned to the serving-folk of the house to make up the
victuals which they should have from the house, to the exclusion of the
other poor folk.

organs,²

Brother John Northamptone, the sub-prior, says as above concerning
silence, that it is not kept, and of the full account as above, that it is not

not treated in seemly wise according to the rule, as in respect of more
delicate foods and medicines, nor is there kept, as is wont, a secular

, serving-man in the infirmary to serve them that are ailing.

Also he says as above concerning the full account, that it is not
rendered, and therefore neither [do they know] of the state of the
house, whether it be in debt or not.

Also he says as above concerning the scarcity of the canons, and yet
those who are [there] are so busy about outward affairs that they come
seldom or sluggishly to [quire], and therefore divine service is not duly
observed, as it ought to be.

Brother Robert Brentyngham says that all things are well.

Brother Thomas Myles, the sub-cellarer, says all things are well, save
this, that it is not known in how far the house is in debt.

Now when these had been examined and had been called together
before my lord a second time on and in the same day, year and place, my
