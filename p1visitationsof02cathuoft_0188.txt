CRoYLANDE.
[Fo. 67.]

Anno Domini mcclxx quarto prouisum fuit et concessum per domi·
num Radulphum abbatem et conuentum quod elemosinarius duos equos
habeat in stabulo ad opus monachorum in viam proficiscendum, videlicet
vnum palefridum et vnum equum ad sumnam² portandam cum toto
apparatu. Et illud idem statutum fuit de pitanciariO. Item prouisum
fuit quod magister operis vnum equum ad minus haberet in stabulo cum
apparatu³. Insuper decretum fuit quod camerarius sex capas honestas
semper haberet ad opus monachorum et sotula⁴ de vacca decentes et duas
sellas honestas ad duos palefridos et vnum ad somerum et vnum barhyd
ad vtilitatem monachorum in viam proficiscencium.

³ This chantry was obviously served in a chapel at or near Peakirk, just across the
Northamptonshire border. ‘ Pegalandia' is one of the names given by ‘ Ingulf' to the old
monastery of Peakirk. It also appears in the account of Croyland given by Ordericus
vitalis, 11, xvii. The tradition recorded in the chronicle (ed. Birch, pp. 70, 71) was that
in 978, when almost all the priests of Peakirk had left their monastery for Croyland,
Turketyl, thre abbot who re-foun·ded CroyIand, at the petition of a few clerks who were left
there, founded a chantry to be served by a priest at Peakirk‚ appointing one Reinfred, ⁸ vir
rnulte literature, ac incredibilis honestatis ’‚ as the first chaplain. The monastery of Pea-
k1rk is said to have been revived in the time of Canum, but met with much local opposition,
and c. ζο48, the abbot Wulfgar or Wulfgaet‚ having been deprived of the old site of his
house, is said to have laid the foundations of a new monastery by the banks of the Welland
¹ in suo manerio magis vicino de Northamburgt’ (i.e. Northborough, Northants). This was
unsuccessful, and the monks of Peakirk, deprived by various claimants of their possessions
in Feakirk‚ Northborough‚ Maxey, Bainton‚ Barnack and Helpston, wandered homeless
until, on the death of Brithmer‚ abbot of Croyland, Edward the confessor preferred Wulfgaet
to the abbacy‚ which he held 1048-52. The chapel of ⁴ Peylonde’ was quite distinct from
the parish church of Peakirk, the advowson of which belonged to the abbot and convent of
Peterborough. It was rebuilt by abbot Wisbech (1470-6 z see note 5 on p. 54 above) : the
