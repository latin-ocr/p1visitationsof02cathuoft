was come to a praiseworthy end, sir William Walesby,¹ the dean of the
said college, delivered to the said reverend father the certificate of my
lord's mandate which had been addressed to him for such visitation,

chaplains of chantries made sufficient exhibition of their letters of orders
and [the titles] of their benefices within and without the college, even
as follows beneath ; and upon examination they say these things which
follow.

Sir William Walesby, the dean, made sufficient exhibition as regards
his orders and in respect of the deanery and prebend and his other
[benefices] and also as regards a dispensation for plurality granted to
him both in general and special, and he sware obedience. Thereafter he
says upon examination that master John Dey,² canon of the place, is
defamed of the vice of sodomy with Thomas Craven, chorister in the
same, who has confessed, and with one of the surname of White, a canon
of Repton, and with Henry Cravene, and with John Burley, chorister, to
some of whom he gave long boots that they should conceal such offences;
and he is a common haunter of the public taverns, even to drunkenness
and vomiting. Let inquiry be made of William Bentley, late the said
master John's cook, now with sir Henry Rose,⁸ canon, and of sir William ’
Derby, the same master John's vicar, and of John VVelforde, who dwells
with sir Henry Rose, canon, and of sir Henry Syleby, vicar to the same

Rose .

[ (S]hiryngham : note.) Sir John Shiryngham,⁴ canon, commits adultery
with the wife of one Ryggesmaydene. On the second day of December
the man appeared in the place of chapter and in person, and denies his
guilt since the time of the purgation which he made before the dean ;
and so of [my lord's favour] he cleared himself on his unsupported oath.
And then my lord warned him under pain of excommunication to have
henceforth no suspicions familiar intercourse with her.

(Welles : note.) Master Ralph Welles,⁵ canon, is defamed with
Alice Norys, late of the parish of blessed Mary at the castle,⁶ of whom he
has begotten offspring, and with Joan the wife of William Heuse of
Leicester‚ and with Alice Spensere, of whom he has begotten offspring ;
and these women have common recourse to the lodging which he has as
Canon, and there do they stay sometimes the whole day and night, and
there he knew them. He appeared and, the first article having been laid
to his charge, denies his guilt from the time of his correction made by

 

 

this by death before 13 Jan.. 1455-6 (Reg. ΧΧ, fo. 207). His name, also spelt Roos, implies
some connexion with the family of that name, lords of Belvoir. Like several of the canons
at this date, he was a presentee of queen Katharine. He was rector of Clipsham, Rutland,
where he succeeded his fellow-canon Fysshewyke, 2 Nov.‚ 1440 (Reg. XVIII, fo. 124d.), but

θ The older collegiate church of St. Mary's-of-the-castle stands on the east side of the
inner bailey of the casde, a short distance north of the Newarke. which formed the outer
ward of the castle. The vicarage of St. Mary‘s, served by one of the chapter, which
consisted of a dean and seven canons, was appropriated to Leicester abbey. For the details
of a concord made between the chapter's of St. Mary's and of the New college in 1358-9‚ see
