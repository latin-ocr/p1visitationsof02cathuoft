INJUNCTIONS FOR THE NEW COLLEGE OF LEICESTER.

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved sons
in Christ the dean and the several canons, vicars and other minister-s
whomsoever of the new collegiate church of blessed Mary of Leicester,
of our diocese, who now are and shall be, health, grace and blessing. It
is part of our charge to reform manners of life in the clergy ancl people
under our authority, to implant virtues and with the weeding-hook of our
jurisdiction as ordinary to tear up and root out vices ; for the which
reasons our visitation as ordinary is known to have been instituted. And·
so in our sometime visitation by our right as ordinary of you and the
said collegiate church, even as our pastoral care prompted us hereunto,
and in our anxious inquiry touching the state of the said church and of
the things belonging thereto and of the ministers thereos, we found
certain things that had been attempted contrary to the form of the
sworn statutes of the said church disclosed and reported to usin such
our inquiry, which were not undeservedly in need of reform. Being
unwilling therefore, even as with a sound conscience we ought not, to
leave such disclosures without correction, we despatch to you our injunc-
tions, ordinances and mandates written beneath, by way of reformation
of such matters disclosed, to be observed for ever without breach by you
and your successors that shall be.

In the first place, inasmuch as in the sworn statutes of the said
college caution is given that at the very least four canons shall be bound
to be present at matins every night, and it has been disclosed to us that
of custom almost all the canons of that church, save one alone who is the

 

¹ Statutes 36 and 37 (possibly united as one statute in the numbered copy ε see note 7
on p. 193 above) prescribed continuat residence‚ allowing for two months' holiday in every
year, either continuously or at intervals, and admitting reasonable or necessary exceptions
approved by the dean and a majority of the chapter. Ii absence was prolonged beyond the
statutory time without cause, the defaulter was bound to pay an amount pro rata out of his
stipend to the fabric fund or some other use of the church ; and such an absence, if lasting
fifteen days, involved deprivation. No more than three canons and three vicars might be
away at once, and all were to return for great festivals.
