INTRODUCTION xxxi

without difficulty by the help of its marginal title.² But, although
Alnwick’s register contains much interesting and varied material among
its small collection of official documents, it was compiled negligently and
imperfectly. The work of transferring documents to it from the rough
copies which existed in the bishop’s chancery was certainly not begun
until Alnwick had been bishop of Lincoln for some years ; and there is
some reason to believe that, instead of being kept as a permanent book
of reference and posted up at proper intervaIS, it was composed from a
mass of imperfect and ill-sorted material towards the end of
Alnwick's episcopate. The memoranda of institutions, for example, are
arranged without regard to consecutive dates. The registrar evidently
worked from detached sheets of paper, such as those which are bound
into Flemyng's register‚ on which were recorded institutions from
all the archdeaconries made at various places and dates.² In copying
these out, he divided the places concerned into their archdeaconries‚ but
made no attempt at chronological order, so that in each archdeaconry
extraordinary dislocations of date are to be found.⁸ Further, the
registrar was not over-careful about his spelling,⁴ his writing was crabbed
and somewhat infirm‚⁵ and his copying was frequently mechanical.⁶ We
cannot be certain in many cases that he dated his documents rightly:
and, in examining the date of each document in the register and
fitting it into the bishop's itinerary, the present editor has found
many documents dated upon the same day from places too remote from
each other to make it likely that the bishop began the day at one and
ended at the other. The probable explanation of this discrepancy‚ in
which Alnwick's register is not singular, is that two sets of dates are
recorded indifferently‚ one referring to the bishop's, and the other to his
vicar-general's movements.
This difficulty appears at the very beginning of Alnwick's episcopate.⁷

ln both these cases the marginal titles in the register‚ printed at the head of the document.
in the present volume, contain specific mention of the persons or religious houses concerned.
But see the general title of the short document printed on p. 183 (no, xxxvux, and cf.

² Reg. XVI, ff. 196-198d. These leaves contain records of institutions which were
subsequently copied for permanent record into the parchment quires relating to the various
archdeaconries.

³ Thus on fo. 108 there is a series of institutions ranging chronologically from 17 May,
1438, to 29 June, 1439. On fo. 108d the dates are in order as follows: 14 Dec.. 1440;
2 April, 1438 ; 12 Sept.‚ 1440 3 4 May, 1438 ; 2 Now, 1448. The institutions on ff. 109-
109d cover4 April. 1448, to 4 July, 1449, without chronological order. On fo. 110 the
dates are: 1 March, 1447-8 3 7 Dec.. 14473 18 and 19 Jan.‚ 1446-7. On fo. 110d: 10 Oct.,
14423 7 Aug, 1443, 11 Oct„ 1442 ; 15 March, 1444-5 : 29 July 1444. On fo. 111 τ
27 and 18 Oct., 1444. This irregular arrangement, which is typical οἱ the whole register,
indicates that the memoranda from which the records were copied were made irregularly,
probably by economising blank spaces in the sheets of paper which were gradually filled up
by the clerks on their travels.

⁵ Cf. note 1 on p. 148 below.

⁶ See, e.g., the careless reading ad statum for adstatim on p. 128 below. A curious
example of carelessness occurs on fo. 109, where the prebend oi Thorngate is called the
prebend οἱ ⁶ Thurgarton.'

dates recorded in his register, the Visitation MS., and the documents printed by Bradshaw ·
