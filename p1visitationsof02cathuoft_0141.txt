BARDNEY ABBEY, 1440 33

Also‚ being almoner‚ he suffers the grange of the almonry hard by
the monastery to become ruinous. He alleges that he has caused a new
house to be built on the said farm at great eost, and, as soon as he can,
he will make the other repairs.

Also he says that the various offices of the monastery which Thomas
Bartone has held are much impaired, because the same Thomas made
up his accounts and reckoned their totals by himself and keeps them in
his own hands : therefore it is not certain in what sort or how the
offices are in debt. He was warned under pain of excommunication to
deliver all such accounts into the treasury.

Also he says that it would be a good thing that the repairs done
within doors and without should be warily surveyed, so that it may be
certain that the allowances asked for will be just and agreeable to equity.
Let the abbot and convent make provision of a surveyor.

Brother William Croyland says that needs must that they have three

, foresters, as was their wont, to maintain their woods ; and now there is

but one kept, and therefore the woods suffer damage. The abbot was
warned in virtue of obedience to cause the fences about the copses to be
diligently surveyed and repaired.

Brother William Yorke‚ the sacrist, asks that timber be allowed him
for the quire of the convent,l and that the garden which he tends be not
taken away from him. Timber was granted him and the garden also, that

he should have them.

Also he asks that at Southrey there may be a serving-man to keep
the cows there, because the monastery is wont to receive more advantage
from that place in butter and cheese than from the monastery.

Brother John Hole says that the copses are not enclosed after felling :
therefore the stumps, when *they sprout again, are destroyed.

Also he says concerning the foresters as above, and that the present
forester appropriates for himself much timber in Horsley and Southwood.²

Brother William Bekeryng says that all is well.

Brother Thomas Suthewelle says that Bartone is past bearing among
the brethren and chides this deponent for making the cloister garden.
My lord relaxed the injunction made to this Bartone to hold his peace
until a certain time, on condition of his good behaviour.

Brother Richard Anderby says that Bartone makes too much haste
in singing the psalms and in other [parts of the service], causing discord
among them when they chant.

Also the same Bartone is past bearing among the brethren, and all

’ that he has he wastes in meat and drink and presentS‚ that he may win

to himself for his support the influence of lay-folk.
Also he speaks of the unwary and improvident sale of manors.

Also Hole says that Bartone has not made him satisfactio-n· for ‘the
