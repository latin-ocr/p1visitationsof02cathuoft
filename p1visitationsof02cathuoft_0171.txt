CATEsBY PRIORY, 1442 48

Taylour. The man appeared in person before my lord in the chureh of
Brampton, and, the article having been laid to his charge, denies the
crime at any time. Wherefore at his own request my lord appointed
him the Saturday next after the festival of [St] Margaret to clear himself
with five chaplains of good report, who have knowledge of his behaviour,

in the chureh of Rothwell, etc.1
The nuns are in ignorance of the receipt and expenses of the house,

] likewise also of the state of the house, because the prioress has never
ἶ rendered an account.

These ten years the prioress has done no repairs except in one piece

of the cloister‚ and then she sold trees to the amount of twenty shillings‚

and to another piece of the chureh, for which she received 26s. 8d. of

the bequest of the wife of Brewes2 of Daventry.
The prioress at the time of her entry had a sack and a half of

Ἴ wool and twelve marks of John Catesby to pay debts and do repairS‚ and

for other needful purposeS.
Also she says that divine service is chanted with so great speed that

no pauses are made.³
Also the prioress is so harsh and headstrong that she may in no

wise be appeased.
Also the prioress's mother knows well the secrets of the chapter and

'Q publishes them in the town. So also does the prioress publish them.

Also in the last visitation which was made by the lord William
Graye,⁴ the prioress said that for a purse and certain moneys a clerk of
the said bishop made known what every nun disclosed in that visitation.

Sister Agnes Allesley says that the prioress sows discord among the

x„ sisterS‚ saying ‘Thus and thus spake such an one of you’, if she to whom

she speaks has transgressed in aught.

Also she says as above concerning the scandal of the prioress and
sir William Taylour, who is now dwelling at Boughton by Northampton ;
and she says that the overmuch kindness between them was a cause of
seandal‚ because she did go out of a morning to the offiees⁵ by herself
but for that chaplain 3 and when the prioress had been told of that
scandal‚ that chaplain after his departure did come to the house thrice
within a month.

The revenues of the house, thirteen years gone by, were worth sixty
pounds a year and now searce fifty pounds ς and this decrease has come
to pass from the ill governance of the prioress and sir William Taylour,
and because of neglect in repair of tenements and in obtaining tenants, etc.

Also two sheep-folds have stood roofless these two years : therefore
the timber is beginning to rot and the lambs yeaned in them have died
owing to the wet. ,

Also she says that at the time of the prioress’s entry the house was
but a little or nothing in debt. Also she found at the same time table—
linen meet to serve the king, and a set of twelve silver spoons 3 and now
all has disappeared, and the spoons and the other vessels which are in
the house belong to the prioress’s mother.

⁴ No other record of this visitation survives, but it may be tentatively put down to the
last days of Dec., 1432, or soon after 1 Jan., 1432-3. See Visitations, 1, introd. p. xxiii,
where, by an oversight, the date of Gray’s visit to Chacombe is given as 1 Jan., 1431-2.
