INTRODUCTION xxi

houses. Just as he asserted his authority as mediator and legislator
over the wrangling dean and chapter of Lincoln,1 so he did his best
to reform the disorders prevalent in such monasteries as Peterborough
and Ramsey. His proceedings at Peterborough and their effect are
discussed in another part of this introduction: they were those of a
diocesan conscious of the duty which the monasteries owed him as
their ordinary and desirous to enforce his anxiety for their better
guidance and governance without undue severity. It is clear also that
he desired to increase their effectiveness as centres of spiritual instruc-
tion and godly learning. He himself was a learned man, not only
versed in canon and civil law, but, as his loan of books from the
library at Garendon indicates, a student of theology.² Among subJects
to which he paid careful attention were the provision of suitable
instructors tor novices and the maintenance of conventual schools, which,
as at Leicester and Thornton, occasionally had fallen into decay,⁸ for
the ‘children of the almery.’ In 1428, while he was still bishop of
Norwich‚ he joined with Thomas Langley, bishop of Durham‚ and John
Hore of Childerley, Cambs., in founding the hostel at Cambridge for
Benedictine studentS, in the first instance from Croyland, which developed
at a later date into Magdalene college.⁴ In certain monasteries‚ learned
monks or canons were ehosen to preach the visitation sermon before
him. His efforts to reform a monastery by introducing into it well-read
men from outside are illustrated in the case of Bardney abbey‚ one of
the most difficult houses with which he had to deal. At his visitation of
Spalding priory in August, 1438, it was reported that a monk named Alan
Kirketon, when he went to the universsty, had taken with him certain
’χ books of the house and two pieces of silver. The books were a Bible,
the Historia scolastica or epitome of biblical history by Petrus Comestor,
the Liber sententiarum of Peter Lombard, the Decretals of Gregory 1x‚
the Liber sextus decretalium with the gloss of the cardinal of Ostia, the
Clementine consitutions, another volume of Decretals, the Decretum of
Gratian‚ the letters of Peter of Blois, the book of concordanceS‚⁵ the
Sermones of Odo, and the F lores of St. Bernard.⁶ When he returned in
1435, he did not bring back the books, and they had not yet been
restored. Kirketon pleaded that he had pawned them to meet his
expenses at Oxford, as the prior had not provided him with enough
money. Since then, however, he had received his arrears, and it seems
probable that the books were recovered. At any rate, when Alnwick
continued his visitation in October, 1438, Kirketon had left Spalding to
become the prior of Bardney.⁷ It can hardly be doubted that he owed
this office to Alnwick’s perception of his qualifications as a serious
student, to which his travelling library, if not his Subsequent treatment
of it, bears witness. The bishop at any rate had sufficient confidence in
him to put the tangled affairs of Bardney and its abbot under his charge
