et singula facturi que litteris vestris predictis continentur cum
obediencia qua decet. Et sic mandatum vestrum reuerendum sumus
obedienter executi ; quod vestre venerende1 paternitati significamus
per presentes· Quam quidem paternitatem reuerendam conseruet in
prosperis Trinitas increata. In cuius rei testimonium sigillum
nostrum presentibus apponi fecimus. Data in monasterio nostro de

Burgo sancti Petri decimo die mensis Septembris, anno Domini

A certificate of the same type, with unimportant variationS, was
returned to the mandate of bishop Chedworth already quoted². It may
also be mentioned that in abbot Depyng's register there is a mandate by
bishop Repyngdon, dated at Eynsham, 10 March, 1413-14, for a
visitation to be held by himself or by his commissaries, masters Thomas
Brouns and David Pryce³ on 14 April following. This is followed by
Depyng's certificate, which bears date 11 April⁴. Neither of these
depart sufficiently from the normal forms already given to demand
reproduction.

It is worth while, however, to compare the words of Alnwick's
Peterborough mandate with those of a citation which is preserved in
his register⁵. This summons has neither date nor indication of the
house to which it was addressed. It occurs among a number of
documents belonging to the last quarter of 1437, and the terms of
the preamble certainly apply so closely to the state of things at
Peterborough in December of that year⁶ that we can hardly doubt that
it was used for Alnwick's first visitation of that monastery and was
subsequently kept as a form for reference. The document has the
marginal title Mandatum pro visitacionc religiosorum. Its text, as is often
the case in Alnwick’s register, was copied mechanically and contains

some obvious errors.
Willelmus, etc. Dolorosa nimis et anxiosa forma⁷ suis tam

vicinas quam remotas partes replens relalitibus⁸ nostro, quod flentes
referrimus⁹, deduxit auditui quod illud insigne et inter cetera huius
regni famosum vestrum cenobium, inclitorum regum manu munifica
dudum nobiliter fundatum amplisque notabilibus possessionibus et
prediis larga fidelium deuocione ditatum, quid per inerciam presidum
necligentem, quid per quorundam secularium ea que ad victum
Christi militum inibi Deo famulancium data sunt ex affectata
conniuencia presidencium huiusmodi, non ex Deo sed ex sanguinibus¹⁰
et voluntate carnis nata, absorbencium quotidianam corrosionem, ad
irreparabilis ruine casum ex verisimili, quod Deus auertat, in proximo
dilabetur. Vrgente idcirco nostre cure solicitudine pastoralis,
descendere compellimur, vt videamus si clamor opere compleatur, ne
sanguis tantorum malorum in extremo judicio de nostris manibus
