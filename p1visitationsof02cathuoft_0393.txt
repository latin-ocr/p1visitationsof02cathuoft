concerning this work. He confesses the receipt of twenty marks, six
marks and twenty marks,1 and will render an account to my lord touching
his receipts and expenses.

„ [Also he says that] by the nature of the foundation² and by the

¹· founder's gift there were in the college six almuces for the dean and the
five canons, whereof one is alienated by the dean. He confesses that he
delivered it to dame Elizabeth Brauncepathe, who promised him that it

, should be delivered back, even as she had received it, to the chapter;

 

wherefore he was warned under pain of excommunication to restore in

as good condition on this side Michaelmas next.

Also he says that what time the said rectory house was let out, as is
aforesaid, on farm, there were in the college 260 sheep and wool of tithe
for two years and of their own as well, and where these are gone is not
known. He says that one sir Simon,3 at that time the proctor of the
college, sold the sheep and wool and spent the money received upon the

‘ household 3 and otherwise he cannot answer to the article, because [he

knows nothing]4 of such things or of the like; and touching this he

[Sir William] Blokley, canon, says that the penalties of them that
keep not the hours according to the statutes are not paid, and says that
the chapter [will not audit] the officers' accounts, albeit they are offered,

under penalty of the payment of double the penalties incurred to exact
himself such penalties incurred according to the statutes.

divine service are not observed, nor the hours for meals also.

Also he says that the dean, the sub-dean and Blokley spend too
much time, and almost every day, in the public taverns, insomuch that
they run the risk of drunkenness, and therefore .......... as is
aforesaid, are not kept. The dean was warned, under pain of giving four
gallons of beer to be spent among the fellows, to *refrain henceforward
from such taverns. ·

Also he says, as above, that sir Robert Careby is defamed with a
married woman of Twywell ; for on the feast of St. Botolph⁵ they were
in manner suspect ......... or at Higham.

Also he says that sir Walter Luffenham, the proctor, is very wasteful
in the expenses, which he makes in costly wise outside the house, and
has rendered no account of his office. He denies the article.

Sir John Burtone, canon, says that Luffenham, proctor of the house,
has continued in that office by the space of three years, and whereas he
should render [an account] by statute twice in the year, he has rendered
no account all his time.

[Also] he says that the goods of the college are squandered by the
improvident governance of the same sir Walter, and he says that the
