BARDNEY ABBEY, 1440 28

your wont, at Southrey or elsewhere without the bounds of the said
monastery, nevertheless from certain causes that move us we grant you
indulgence to keep such your seynies, according to the custom of the
same monastery, at Southrey and not elsewhere without the monastery,
until we shall have thought fit to ordain otherwise, our aforesaid injunc-
tion or the penalty attached thereto notwithstandlng3 provided only,
beloved son the abbot, that you lend your presence continually to such
seynies with your brethren and keep a diligent eye to their governance,¹
and that the expenses to be incurred in the same place during the
seynies do not exceed the expenses which in like manner would be
incurred in the monastery, and that peace, concord and unity be alto-
gether preserved among you both within and without the monastery.

We enjoin upon you moreover, beloved son the prior, in virtue of
obedience and under pain of excommunication, which not without desert
you shall be able to fear, if you do not that which we command, that, if
any quarrels, bickerin gs, strifes or disagreements arise henceforth among
the brethren of the same monastery, you fail not to inform and notify us
as soon as you may, without the evasion of any delay, touching the same
and their instigators and accomplices.

But because we, being of late in the said monastery, when we
absolved you, brother Thomas Bartone, from the durance in prison
wherein because of your ill deserving you were confined, did ordain and
straitly enjoin upon you that. you should in no wise go outside the bounds
of the said monastery, nor intermeddle with any matter or concerning
any matter whatsoever, but, being content with such your deliverance,
you should keep such bounds and take your daily meals with brother
William Burghe in the infirmary,2 we therefore strictly enjoin and com-

ν mand you, under penalty of your being thrust back again into such

durance as a prisoner, that you keep this our ordinance without breach,
in no wise starting aside from any part thereof.

Given under our scal, etc., [in our manor] of Nettleham, on the
first day of April in the year of our Lord 1440, and the thirteenth year
of our consecration and fourth of our translation.

IV.
[BARDNEY]

As my lord was sitting as a tribunal in the chapter-house of the
monastery of Bardney, of the order of St. Benet, of the diocese of Lin-
coln, on the sixth day of the month of October in the year of our Lord
1440, there appeared before him on and in the same day and place the

. abbot and the several monkS, except Elkyngtone, who is of the diocese

of York,·⁹’ and Lincoln, who is at Lincoln, and Bekeryng, who on this

held the office of cellarer, though apparently without much effect, in 1437-8, when he duly
submitted to visitation. It is therefore more likely (2) that he had temporarily been placed
in charge of the large estates of Bardney at and near Hunmanby in the east Riding of
Yorkshire, where his position would be equivalent to that of the custos of the foreign
property of a monastery, such as those who had looked after the so-called ¹ alien priories’
until the previous generation. In this case he would be temporarily amenable to the
jurisdiction oi the archbishop of York.
