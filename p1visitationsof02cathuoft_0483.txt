LEICESTER‚ NEW coLLEGE, 1440 ’ 205

and that you, provost, who now are, withdraw and withhold such salaries
or stipends from the said vicars, albeit the same have performed their
duties, as regards the terms of the annunciation of blessed Mary and of
St. Michael, in the year of our Lord 1440, save that you have paid each
of thern four Shillings only, we therefore strictly enjoin and command
you who now are provost and everyone to be called in future to your
place in the same office, under pain of the excommunication aforesaid,
that, if so it be, seeing that the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn ought not to be kept by a muzzle from his manger, you shall take
care to pay the aforesaid vicars who fulfil such their duty their aforesaid
salaries or stipends at the terms appointed for this purpose, in their
entirety and without any subtraction and delay.¹

Also seeing that in the sworn statutes of the said church it is
ἓζὲιῖῗῖζὲἓὲἑᾶἑῖἳῖἑῖῗὲιὲῂὲῑρὲῗὲἓῗηὲἒὲἓῖ 3¹35ssss {32 3230?oe 3222?
that he himself shall do faithful ministry in such his office and shall
earnestly apply what due diligence he can as regards good and faithful
administration in respect of all temporal and spiritual goods whatsoever
belonging to the same church and the other affairs of the same church,
save only the offex-ings made in the same church, and it stands disclosed
to us that you, now the provost, say that you are not bound to do your
ministry as regards the goods that since the publication of such the
statutes have been granted to the said church, which are not great, and
therefore take no order for administration in respect of the same, to the
damage, no little prejudice and grievance of the said church and the
ministers thereos, we therefore, remarking that according to the intention
of the words of such statute, which speaks uncertainly, with reference
neither to past matters only nor, even so, to those following or to come,
you are bound by the force and virtue of the words of such statute to do
your administration faithfully in respect of all the goods of the said
church whatsoever, enjoin and command you the provost aforesaid and
everyone to be put in your place in future in the same office, under pain
of the excommunication aforesaid, apart from the penalty of perjury
inflicted by the said statute upon him who keeps it not, to do diligent
administration and ta'ke heed so to do it in respect of all the goods of the
said church whatsoever granted and to be granted before and after the
publication of such the statutes, faithfully requiring, levying, collecting
and receiving them and allotting them to their due uses and rendering
faithful account concerning them, your aforesaid statement, which we
esteem to be trifling, notwithstanding.2

Also seeing that by the virtue of such statutes it appertains to and is
incumbent upon the office of you the sacrist to provide bread, wine and
water daily for the sacrament of the altar at every altar of the same
church and also in the chapel of the infirmary, and it stands disclosed to
us, which we say with abhorrence, that the wine furnished for such
ministry is so tasteless and unwholesome that it has sometimes provoked
them that receive it to retching and sickness, we therefore, taking heed
that, according to the witness of the old and new law, sacrifice should be
offered of the best, strictly enjoin and command you who are now sacrist
and everyone who shall succeed you in the same office, under pain of the
