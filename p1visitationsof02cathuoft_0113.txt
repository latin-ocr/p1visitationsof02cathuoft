<Against the baker.) Also he says that the baker's perquisites amount
to ten marks and more a year, and he is of no use to the monastery,
while the two who sometime held the office of baker and brewer did not
get as much as this one man gets.

Also he says that at one time they were wont to have in the stew-
ponds that belong to the monastery 300 or 400 pike‚ and all these Bar-
tone has almost brought to nothing by squandering them, giving to

send to market to get fish for the convent ; and whereas in those days
the convent used to be served with three or four sorts of fish, now they

'are hardly served with two.

’ Also he says that one Graystoke of Bardney and his wife have too
much access to the chamber of brother Thomas Bartone in the infirmary,

whereby comes cause of scandal to the monastery and the victuals and
other goods of the monastery are wasted.

cellarer to keep the abbot's hall and receive the guests while the abbot
is away 3 the said Bartone, leaving the hall to itself, keeps his own
chamber where he is served with choicer victuals, while the guests are
served with the middling sorts.

Also he says that the abbot who was the last to die said to the same
