lxii INTRODUCTION

necessary. Arbitrary action, justifiable though it might be on general
grounds, might bring him into collision, not merely with the whole
house, but with its patrons and tenants. His jurisdiction was purely
spiritual, and at every point he had to meet problems in which spiritual
interests were closely interwoven with temporal. He could hardly hope
to work wholesale reformation where it was needed ; and his only
course was to make his corrections mildly and paternally and to trust to
the influence of the solemn and peremptory language of his injunctions.

Readers may be left to form conclusions for themselves upon the
general state of monasteries and secular colleges which these visitations
disclose. What the present writer has to say upon this head has been
said already in the introduction to the volume to which this forms a
sequel.¹ The conclusions which he embodied there were put into writing
after the Alnwick MS. had been transcribed by him, and he finds nothing in
them to alter or modify. He would ask his readerS, however, to keep
before their minds the fact that the object of the documents contained
in the following pages is to discover faults, not to publish virtues; and
that, if their record of faults is patent, the modern student, in the lack of
other evidence, is bound in all fairness to accept the facts and avoid
censure. No better example, indeed, could be found, in forming a judg-
ment from the evidence before us, than Alnwick’s own tact and patience
in his work of visitation ; and, if the character of the disclosures
occasionally repels sympathy, we can at least extend lenience to short-
comings which are inalienable from human nature,

In the preliminary business of most of the visitations there will be
found a record of the certificate presented in compliance with the
bishop's mandate. For purposes of reference, it may be useful to
supplement this introduction with some specimen texts of such mandates
and one example of a certificate of their execution. These are taken
from the register of Richard Assheton and William Ramsey, abbots
of Peterborough‚ which is preserved in the cathedral library there. By
kind permission of the dean and chapter of Peterborough, the present
editor has been enabled to copy and calendar a large number of
important documents from this Ms., which is of peculiar interest as
covering most of the period of Alnwick’s episcopate, and as forming an
immediate sequel to the register of abbots Genge and Depyng, now in
the British Museum. .

The most simple form of mandate, which was probably employed in
most cases, is that used by bishop Chedworth in 1457² and by bishop
Rotherham-in 1473.³ This is substantially one form, although many
variations ot phrase are employed, and Chedworth's text is printed here,
w1th Rotherham's variations in the foot-noteS. Italicised words and
passages in tne text are omitted in Rotherham’s mandate.
