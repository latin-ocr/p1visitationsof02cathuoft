ivi INTRODUCTION ‘

the women themselves came before the bishop for sentence at Liddington
in December. The abbot had been charged to see to their removal
before 1 November τ nevertheless, they were still in their old homes.
They both denied their guilt, and the bishop, considering that the
abbot had been and was a distinguished prelate and that his honour
should as far as possible be left without a stain, expressed his desire to
deal mercifully with them, and ordered them to leave their abodes before
Candlemas without further process

Richard Harleton, who had been prior for many years, begged at Ἴ
this visitation to be relieved of his charge on the ground of old age. It
appears that he had practically left the monastery to live in greater ease
at Oxney, the special retreat of infirm monkS, and that he could not
exercise his office without serious fatigue. There were, moreover,
complaints against his deputies, and he recognised that discipline and
the property of the convent were no longer prospering under his rule.
The bishop, considering his past labours for the good of the house,
refused to accept his resignation there and then, but ordered that it
should be accepted by the abbot at Michaelmas, about three weeks later.
This apparently was carried out, as in the following February, when
Alnwick continued the adjourned visitation‚ William Extone, formerly
steward, was the prior.

On 8 February, 1446-7, when the bishop returned, he held a long
consultation in the chapter-house for the better government of the
temporal goods of the house. Darkness fell and nothing was settled,
when the abbot brought matters to a head by agreeing to put the
temporalities into commission. The new prior, Harleton, the steward
and treasurer we're named as guardians ; and the commission was to last
for two years. An agreement was drawn up and submitted to the
convent next day. The abbot‚ however, had thought better of his
unconditional surrender and now begged Alnwick not to put him to
open disgrace, but to allow him the administration of temporalities‚ with
the four commissioners as a council of advice. After taking an oath
from each of the convent to observe the ordinance, the bishop decreed
that the abbot‚ with the help of the consultative body of four, whose
places, in case of a vacancy, were to be filled by the abbot and
convent alternately, should retain the control of the temporalities for the
next two years, doing nothing which involved risk of dilapidation with-
out their consent. Meanwhile, he was to retire from Peterborough to
Oxney, taking with him a chaplain of good repute, and to come to the
monastery only when he was needed upon business matters. The
scandal about the three women had not yet died down, and they were
apparently still living in communication with the abbot ; but the end of
this matter is not recorded. Whether further measures were taken at the
end of the two years is also left untold.¹ Assheton, however, whatever
his early excesses may have been, seems to have recovered his character
and position. He ruled the monastery until 1471 with some success ; and
it is to his initiative that we owe the two volumes of the Peterborough
customary, now preserved in the library of Lambeth palace.

In the case of a smaller monastery, the nunnery of St. MichaePs,
Stamford, we have reports of three visitations with one set of injunctions.²
