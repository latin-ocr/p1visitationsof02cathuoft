process about to take place and them also who heard it, and according
tO this text, ⁴ Save thy life and look not behind thy back‚' etc. And when
this was come to a praiseworthy end, [the prioress] delivered tO my lord
his mandate which at another time had been addressed for the visita-
tion to the same prioress, averring that she had performed it according
to its effect, but that she knows not how to compose a formal certificate,

· in that she has no lettered persons of her counsel who are skilled in this

case ; but she furnished the names of her sisters and herself in lieu ot a
certificate. Therefore my lord had her excused herein ; and at length,
when she had furnished such names, my lord asked Of the prioress exhi-
bition of the title of the confirmation of her election.l But she says that
she has none< that she knows ot: howbeit from the day whereon she
received my lord's mandate she has made diligent search but has found
it in no wise. And thereafter On examination she says these things
which follow.

Darne Joan Thorpe‚² the prioress, says that the nuns do keep divers
households‚ to wit by two and two 3 and yet they receive nothing of the
house but bread and beer ; and she says that they take nothing for the
admission of nuns, save that which the friends of her who is to be
admitted do offer of their free-will and not by agreement.

Also she says that as regards rents the house is not [worth] above
ten pounds, and she says that the house is much in debt to the rector of
Flixboi·ough.³

Also she says that they have no boarders above ten years of age of
female and eight [years] of male sex.

Also she says that the rector of Flixborough is their steward and he
busies himself with their temporalities, and not she.

Darne Mary Barwe, the sub-prioreSS‚ says that all things are well.

somewhat negligent as regards corrections, insomuch that the others
⁴ who are younger in religion take little account ot her or her corrections.

Dame Alice Feryby says that all things are well.

Dame Joan Pygot says that all things are well.

recorded. See Vz'sitations Ι, 207.
