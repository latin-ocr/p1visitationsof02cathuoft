ΠΙ.
[BARDNEY]

On the seventeenth day of the month of March in the year of our
Lord 1439, in the chapter-house of the monastery of Bardney, of the
order of St. Benet, of the diocese of Lincoln, in the presence of the
reverend father and lord, the lord William, by the grace of God bishop
of Lincoln, as on and in the same day and place he was sitting in the
capacity of judge‚ there appeared in person the abbot and the several
monks of the said place, except brother Thomas Bartone. And the same
reverend father explained to them the cause of his coming, one, to wit,
that now for a long time it was told him in London² that the monks were
not obedient to the same abbot, but⁸ that for this cause there was great
disorder in the monastery 3 in the third place, that it has been told him

insufficient for the governance of himself and the same monastery in
things spiritual or temporal, and therefore of necessity a coadjutor must

anyone appointed him and [if so]‚ whom, albeit he himself for the cause
aforesaid could commission one for him even without his [the abbot's]

Alan Kirketone, the prior of that place,⁴1 should be assigned him as a
coadjutor to give him aid and hold such office, inasmuch as he himself
because of such infirmities is notoriously incapable of the governance of
the said monastery, both within doors and without. The same abbot
therefore begged the said reverend father that he would deign to
commission the same brother Alan to be his coadjutor. Wherefore
after some little space the said reverend father gave commission to the
aforesaid Alan, albeit Alan was somewhat reluctant, to be coadjutor to
the said brother John, the abbot, at and with his [the abbot's] express

istration in respect of the temporalities of the said monastery, and will
render when he may be required a full and faithful account of his
administration. And then the said abbot proffered the like oath that he
will administer nothing at all nor dispose of the temporalities of the said
monastery without and except with the will, knowledge and consent of
the said brother Alan his coadjutor. And then the same reverend father
