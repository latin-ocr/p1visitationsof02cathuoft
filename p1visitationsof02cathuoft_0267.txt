FOTHERINGHAY coLLEGE, 1438 97

eringhay ought to be applied only to the augmentation of the commons
of the fellows in college and not to other uses, nevertheless they no
longer live on commons, but each priest pays sixty shillings in the lump
for his victuals. And he believes that if they lived on commons as above,
it would be more profitable by a large sum that they should so abide, so
that they could have in their treasure the means whereby they could be
satisfied for one table1 in ready money.

Also he says that by the statutes the revenues of the college should
be laid by in a chest under three keys², and, whenever there was need of
money, it should be paid by the keepers of such keys ; for now the mas-
ter receives all by himself and pays by himself.

Also whenever any are in ill health, they are ill served with food.
Prayer therefore is made that, since every one pays sixty shillings a year
for his board, the which amounts to fourteen pence a week, and [when]
it chances that anyone is in ill health, either the master shall provide the
ailing man with more delicate food as his appetite demands, or shall pay
back to the ailing man according to the time of his sickness the sum paid
by him, that he may provide for himself.

Also he says that it is desired, as regards the governance of the coll-
ege, that no married man shall have any rule over the household, but the
fellows of the college, as has been the wont of old3 for by means of
Redburne, who now holds rule, the college suffers great damage in
reputation and in food. ’

Also he says of the statutes as above, that they are not read accord-
ing to the statutes.

Also he prays that Redburne may answer by schedule³ to the dis·
closures concerning him.

Also he says of the masses for the king and the founder and his obit⁴

⁷ ⁷ ’ as above, that they are not kept.

Also he says of their clothing as above, that it is in arrear.

Also he says that without the knowledge of the fellows the master
sold 120 quarters of malt at forty pence [a quarter]. He prays therefore
that the master shall do no business without the acquaintance of the
fellows of the college.

Sir Thomas Nortone, priest, perpetual fellow of the college, says as
above, that satisfaction is not made to the fellows of their pay at the
[statutory] terms.

Also he says of Redburne as is deposed by the others above, and
especially that he is profitable to the college in naught.

Also he says that whereas by the statutes they should have only five
secular serving-folk in the college,⁵ they now forsooth have eight, to wit,
a steward, a butler, the cook with two under him and the baker with a
servant, and a purveyor who is also the barber.

Also he says that whereas in years past a fixed number of salted fish
and stockfish was enough for thern for a year and a quarter beyond, this
last year more fish by sixty than usual were bought, and all these were

answer to each article.

⁴ The founder's obit, payments for which are prescribed in statute 50, was on 2 5 Oct.,
the anmversary of the battle of Agincourt, at which he fell.
, ⁵ Four servants, or five at the most, were allowed by statute 24. One was to be the
narber and was also to be able to mend and repair the vestments and other ornaments.
