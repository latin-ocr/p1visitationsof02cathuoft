GRACEDIEU ΡΕΙΟΗῩ, 144o-1 123·

She comes not to quire by day or by night on Sundays or on the

other feast-days.

She goes out to work in autumn alone with sir Henry, he reaping
the harvest and she binding the sheaves, and at evening she [comes]
riding behind him on the same horse.

-She is over friendly with him and has been since the doings

, , aforesaid.

Of her trust in her own judgment she holds the rest of her sisters in

contgrlrilgtdoes not suffer Chesham her fellow treasurer to have knowledge

of the receipts or payments.

The serving-folk come to meals not together but in scattered parties.

Chesham comes not to quire of a night. Such article having been
laid to her charge, she says that the prioress has appointed her to do
service in the infirmary to three old nuns who lie therein every night,
and [she] with them in like manner, and she does them service day and
night, washing them and doing all else like a laywoman z she prays
therefore to be restored to dorter and quire and the other regular
observanceS. She will willingly watch that fit service be done them by
da .

y Agnes Poutrelle and Isabel Jurdane, who style themselves the
prioress's disciples, are thereby the cause of quarrel between her and her
sisters. forasmuch as what they hear and see among the nuns they
straightway retail to the prioress They both appeared and, the article
having been laid to their charge, expressly deny it and all things that are
contained therein ; wherefore they cleared themselves without com-
purgators: howbeit, that they may not be held suspect hereafter touching
these matters or offend herein, they both sware upon the holy gospels of

’ God that henceforth they will discover to the prioress concerning their

sisters nothing whereby cause of quarrel or incentive to hatred can be
furnished among them, unless they be such matters as may tend to the
damage of the prioress's body or honour.

Sir Henry the chaplain busies himself in unseemly taskS, cleansing
the stables, and goes to the altar without washing, staining his vestments.
He appeared and, such article having been laid to his charge, he
expressly denies the matters contained in the same: howbeit he was
lsawomfthat henceforward he will not commit whatever he has done

ereto ore.

He goes to country places with Belers alone, harvesting [and]
haymaking and making stacks in the barns. He expressly denies his
solitary roaming in the fields with the said Belers : howbeit he confesses
that he has been in the fields with the others and BelerS, carting hay
and helping to pile the sheaves in stacks in the barn.

He is without devotion and irreverent at the altar and is of ill
reputation at Loughborough and elsewhere where he has dwelt : he was
sworn to behave himself devoutly and reverently henceforward at the
altar in making his bow after and before his masses

After these things and the publication of the disclosures in such
visitation, and also after my lord had laid to the charge of the prioress
and cellaress severally all that had been disclosed concerning them, and-
also after their answers to the same, my lord, sitting in his capacity of
Judge in the said chapter-house in the same place on the :nst day of
January in the year aforesaid, inasmuch as the prioress confessed that
