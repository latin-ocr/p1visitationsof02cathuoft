BICESTER.

j. Brother John Smythe, priest, says that whenever the canons who
stay and study in the cloister from day to day ask licence of the sub-
prior to take recreation, he excuses himself, averring that he has not the
power to do this, because such licence resides in the prior when he is
absent from cloister‚ nor, as he says, does he dare to give furlough to
the canons 3 and so the same canons are obliged to abide in the cloister
without any recreation.

The allowance for the canons’ raiment is paid with too much delay.
Sometimes the allowance for the Easter term is paid a little before
MichaelmaS‚ etc.¹ Therefore a provision is requested that the terms
may be observed.

ij. Brother William Bathe agrees with brother John Smythe in the
two detecta aforesaid.

The same says that there were of late put in pawn in London with-
out the consent of the chapter or convent one [silver] gilt cup or [silver]
gilt pyx for the Body [of Christ], and two chalices, two silver basonS,
one very good piece [of plate], of the which the pyx came home
yesterday by itself.

iij. Brother William Bowbury says that the frater is wanting in
laths under the tiles,2 and so is the chapter-house.

The same agrees with brother John Smyth so far as regards the
denial of licence to the canons by the prior.³
