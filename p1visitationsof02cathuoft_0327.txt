deponent says, he cannot give evidence ot¹ the confirmation or invalida·
tion of the said election. Interrogated further if he knows aught of the
installation of the said elect, this deponent says that on the morrow of
the said Wednesday, to wit one Thursday, this deponent was present in
the church of the convent and the chapter-house in the same, when the
dean of Akeley, at that time the rector of Swithland,l as he believeS, by
the authority of the archdeacon of Leicester's official² brought the said
elect into the chapter-house, and afterwards into the couventual church,
and set her in the prioress's seat in the quire. Interrogated what
or what sort of words the dean uttered when he set the said elect in such
her stall, he says that he does not recollect.

Hem-y Iretone of Belton, layman, os forty-four years of age and
upwards, of free estate and good fame, as he says, having been
received as a witness and diligently examined as above, agrees with the
former his fellow witness, save in this, that he has known the elect only
thirty years, and that he did not journey to Sleaford with the elect, and
with this addition, that the said elect proffered her oaths in the chapter-
house to obey the lord bishop and the archdeacon‚ etc.
