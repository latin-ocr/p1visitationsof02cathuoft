INTRODUCTION xv

does not seem to have been a king’s clerk when his estate in Golds-
borough church was ratified in 141913 but in the dispensation granted
to him in May, 1421, >to hold an incompatible benefice with his
archdeaconry, he is called secretary to king Henry v,2 and he is men-
tioned as king’s clerk in December, 1422, when he obtained a grant
of the hospital of St. James by Westminster, three months after the
accession of Henry vl. It is thus probable that he became a king’s
clerk about the time ot his promotion to the archdeaconry of Salisbury.
On 15 Dec., 1422, he was installed in the prebend of Wildland in St.
Paul’s.³ He was appointed keeper of the privy seal about 19 Dec., 1422,⁴
during Beaufort's administration of 1424-6, and continued to hold the
office in Kempe's ministry of 1426,ὅ probably resigning it in 1428.6 There
is some evidence of his attachment to the Beauforts in the fact that
the cardinal’s brother, Thomas, duke of Exeter, who died in 1427, named
him first among his executors⁷3 and among his political friends he
appears to have counted Ralph, lord Cromwess, whom he joined in the
foundation of the college of Τ31161511311.8 His activity, however, as a
statesman did not continue long after his preferment as bishop of Nor-
wich in 1426 3 subsequently, probably about 1430, after the death of the
Carmelite friar Thomas Netter, he became confessor to Henry VI, a post
’ which he held when in 1436 he was appointed bishop of Lincoln. In
1437 Henry appointed him, in company with Beaufort and the duke of
Gloucester‚ to supervise the executors of the will of the queen-mother
Katherine⁹ ; and he bore his part in the foundation of the royal colleges
of blessed Mary of Eton and St. Mary and St. Nicholas at Cambridge.

From these facts it will be seen that Alnwick’s career was that of
2 the ordinary prosperous secular clerk, an university man with a legal
education, rising from the service ot a well-born and influential ecclesi-
astic to positions of trust under the Crown and, in this particular instance,
to close friendship with the king. Of his activity as a diocesan bishop
and in the furtherance of education more will be said in the sequel.
Here, however, it is necessary to remark that such notices of him as have
hitherto been printed contain errors which give a singularly misleading
idea ot' his early life. These may be taken in order.

The first concerns his origin and appears to be more recent than
any of the rest. The late Mr. A. F. Leach, in his book upon The Schools
of Medieval England, says that ‘in 1448 a chantry for two priests was
founded at Alnwick, his native place, by Bishop Alnwick of Lincoln, who
was a Percy, brother of the Earl of Northumberland.’1⁰ As a matter of
fact, Alnwick was only one of the founders of this chantry, to which
allusion will be made later. Where Mr. Leach obtained the information
