· Occasionally the certificate of the receipt and execution of the bishop’s
visitation mandate1 was imperfectly drawn up, as in some nunneries,
where the inmates had little Latin. Sometimes the original foundation-

“’ charter could not beofound or was illegible ε sometimes the only copy was

had no written evidence of the confirmation of her election to show.
ss.. More rarely, as at Leicester abbey (no. XLI), the bishop was met with
s direct contumacy: here the abbot refused to show him anything,
and consequently was not admitted to give evidence. Thus the opening
s record, albeit its phraseology suffers from tedious iteration, was liable to
departure from conventional lines ; and at Gracedieu the matter of the

⁷. prioress’ election became the subject of a formal inquiry. It follows
ᾗ therefore that, when the results of the visitation were sifted for use, this

’ preamble had to be taken into account.

expedited by appointing commissaries to examine different sets of
Nwitnesses in parts of the building distant from each other. The method
{²² of examination may be inferred from the answers : questions were asked,
founded upon the rule and constitutions of the order and the statutory
² observances of the particular monastery, and complaints were freely
‚511 - elicited. The depositions were occasionally presented in writing ; and
of one or two of these bills of complaint such as that delivered by the
prior of Peterborough in 1437, the originals remain and have been

“ Unfortunately, the Gracedieu record, so complete in other respects,
contains none of the clues by which the practica] manipulation of the

Daventry (no. xlv) supplies us with one that is simple and frequently used.
This, denoted in the present volume by a word or words in cui-ved
brackets prefaced to each paragraph of the detecta, was to place the

“ the margin beside it. Another, employed at Ankerwyke (no. Ι), was to
s: number the detecta: here, where a detectum occurs more than once, a
² reference is made to the number given to its first occurrence. This use
⁸ of numbers was employed at times rather arbitrarily 3 and it is difficult
to see any existing reason for the marginal numbers of the two Leicester
visitations of 1440, which may refer to a preliminary setting-out of the
