THE VISITATION OF THE DEAN AND coLLEGE or THE coLLEcrATE
cHURcH OF BLESSED PETER OF IRTHLINGBOROUGH, OF
THE DIOCESE OE Lmeomv, PERFORMED IN THE CHANCEL or THE
SAME COLLEGIATE CHURCH IN LIEU OF A CHAPTER-HOUSE,1 ON
vTHE LAST DAY ΒΗΤ ONE OF THE MONTH OF JUNE, IN THE YEAR
OF OUR LORD 1442. ΒΥ THE REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST AND
LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM, BY THE GRACE OF Gon BI'SHOP OF
L1NcoLN, IN THE SIXTEENTH YEAR OF H1s CONSECRATION AND
THE SIXTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, first and before all else, [the word of God] was
set forth in public by the honourable master John Beverley, professor of
holy writ, in agreement with the process about to take place, in the same
church, after this text, ‘Seek ye the kingdom of God and His righteous-
ness,’ etc. And when this had been finished in the Latin tongue, there
appeared before the [said] reverend father, as he was sitting on and in
the same day and place in the beginning and fulfilment of the business
of such his visitation, the dean [and canons] of the said church, six in
number,² in readiness, as was apparent, to undergo such visitation. And
, then sir Thomas More3 delivered to my lord the certificate of the mandate
which had been addressed to him for such visitation, after these words.
‘ To the reverend,' etc. The which having been read through, the same

» v dean sware canonical obedience and [exhibited] the title of his incum-

bency. He shewed also the charters of the erection and foundation of
the college, the statutes also and the modification thereos :² Then Walter

142).. Robert careby, the junior canon, was inst. 12 May, 1442 (ibai, so. 128d.): it is not
recorded when he resigned 3 but two canonries were filled up in 1447 and 1448 (ibim, fl. 138,
139d.)‚ one of which may have been Luffenham's and the other Careby’s. Aster the earliest
institutions‚ the numbers of the prebends to which canons were instituted are not given, and
it is evident that they occupied their stalls according to seniority.

⁴ The ordination of the college and its statutes are registered in a book belonging
to the abbot and convent of Peterborough, Add. MS. (EM.) 25, 288, ff. 65d.-70d. A large
portion of the statutes has unfortunately been torn out. There is no copy in the episcopal
registers at Lincoln, which is explained by the commission of the bull os foundation to the
archdeacon of London instead of the diocesan. The series οἱ documents connected with the
foundation is somewhat complicated. John Pyel, mercer and citizen of London, obtained
a bull for the foundation of the college from Gregory XI, addressed to the bishop of Lincoln
from Avignon, 9 July, 1373. On 4 Feb., 1374-5‚ Edward 111 granted a lieenee to the abbot
and convent of Peterborough‚ the patrous ot the church, to erect it, with the will and assent
of John Pyel, into a collegiate church, and to transfer the advowson to the college, with

, lieenee to the college to appropriate the church (Cal. Pat. 1374-7, p. 72). John Pyel's

will, 25 June, 1379, proved 22 Aug„ 1382, shews that the foundation was incomplete at
his death (Reg. ΧΠ, ff. 242-3: see extracts in Archoeol. sournal Lxx, 349-50); and the
petition of his widow and executrix to Richard 11 sets forth that some difficulty had been
caused by the unreadiness of bishop Buckingham to execute the original bull, which was
actually defective, as it had omitted to give the bishop's name. She therefore obtained a
new buu from pope Urban VI, dated Gema, 10 June 1386, directed to Thomas Baketon,
archdeacon of London, authorising him to proceed to the foundation of the college ; and a
further licence from the Crown, 12 March, 1387-8, for which she paid a fine of twenty marks,
empowered the archdeacon to act, the consent of the abbot and convent of Peterborough
having been obtained under the earlier Crown lieenee (Cal. Pat. 1385-9, p. 428); Monasticon
VI (3), 1384). On 29 Feb., 1392-3‚ Roger Aswardeby resigned the rectory of the church to
the archdeacon in the priory church of St Helen, Bishopsgate‚ and the archdeacon proceeded
to erect the church into a college, appointing Richard Marcefeld of F risby the first dean, and
collating two canonries and prebends to Robert‚ son of John Toulislond of Southo‚ and
Henry Lord of Olney respectively. The foundation of the three remaining canonries was
