FOTHERINGHAY COLLEGE, 1438 104

four years and upwardS‚ of free estate, of good report, admitted as a
witness, sworn and diligently examined whether she has known John
Redburne to take away any victuals from the college, says straight out
no. She says, however, that she heard a serving-woman of the said John
Redburne say that John, the college-cook, was the best cook in her
master's house, and that sometimes for a month there has not been a pot
set to the fire [in that house] to cook food withal. And otherwise she

cannot depose.

John Wengrave of Fotheringhay‚ of the age of fifty years and up-
wards, of free estate and good report, as he says, admitted as a witness,
sworn and diligently inquired of touching the aforeset consumption and
removal of food-stuff, and first, whether he knows John Redburne and
how long he himself has dwelt in Fotheringhay, says that he has dwelt
in Fotheringhay seven years and that he has known John Redburne ever
since last Michaelmas. Interrogated [concerning] the victuals taken
away from the college by Redburne and his serving-folk, he says that he
has never known aught of him but fealty. Howbeit, he has heard the
same Redburne's Ellen say many a time this year that all the victuals
they have from her master's house are those that are brought there from
the college, and sometimes by the space of a month there was not a pot
set on the fire in her master’s house; and that once, when her master
was away with the master of the college, she heard the same Ellen wish
for their return, declaring that, if they did not come back quickly, they
that were at home would die of hunger. More she says that she knows
not. .
Margaret, wife of the same John Wengrave of Fotheringhay, ot* the
age of twenty-nine years, admitted as a witness, sworn, etc., says that she
has made her abode in Fotheringhay seven years and has known Red-

* burne this past year. Interrogated concerning the taking away of victuals

from the college by Redburne and his servants, she agrees with her hus-
band examined above, as to the [sett]ing of the pot on the fire. Inter-
rogated whether her husband was present, she says no. And she says
[that] on a feast-day whereot' she has no sure recollection, the said Ellen
came into the house of this sworn witness, where were then present
Agnes Gryffone, Thomas Bost[one], John Base and sir John Toune, eat-
ing of bees and mutton which she had in her lap, and they stank so sorely
that this sworn witness shrank from them, asking her whence she had
that stinking meat which she was eating. And she said, in college, and
it was of the kind wherewith the priests and the other clerks therein are
served, and she had it in the larder the sels-same day. And another
time whereof she has no recollection, being invited by this sworn witness
[to] drink, she said that in her mistress's house they had of the best
food that might be in the college, of baked, boiled and roast. And
yesterday week she brought in her lap a pig's head, which, as she de-
clared, fell by chance from the lap of little Joan, Redburne's daughter,
and they eat it together in the same place, she, moreover, declaring that
the said girl was carrying three pigs' heads and a breast of mutton
from the cook of the college. And more or otherwise, as she says, she
knows not to depose. ·

seven years and upwards, of free estate, etc, admitted as a witness,
