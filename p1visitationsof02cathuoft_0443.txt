LEGBOURNE PRIORY, 1440 1 85

because she said it was more suitable that they should correct themselves
than [that] others [should correct them].

Also she says that the present prioress without advice of the bishop,
but with the will of the convent, sold a corrody to one Robert Warde,
who is the bailiff of the temporalities of the house and yet is not
reckoned profitable to the house in that office, for several of his kinsfolk
are serving-folk in the house, who look out for themselves more than for
the house.

Also she says that the rector of Reston,l who was the confessor
appointed them by my lord that now is, is now dead and so they are
deprived of such a confessor.

Also she says that the tenements and houses producing rent which
belong to the priory are exposed to ruin by reason of the carelessness of
the prioress and bailiff and will soon fall to pieces unless a remedy be
applied.

Also she says that because of the witlessness and thoughtlessness of
the prioress and sub-prioress the constitutions of the order and the other
regular observances are not kept in time οἱ mass.

Also she says that when they are at work they do not wear scapulars
according to the rule,‘² and this in the prioress's default.

Darne Isabel Otteley says all things are well.

Dame Margaret Kyghley says as above concerning the need of
appointing a new confessor.

Darne Maud Multone‚ the sub-prioress, says that at matins, mass,
vespers and the other day-hours they are bound [to make] memorials of
St. Benet and of St. Bernard, and now for long past they have left out
and do leave out such memorials. ι

Darne Alice Blytone says that the prioress admitted sir Thomas, a
certain chaplain, to preach within the quire of the said priory‚ and so he
did preach therein in the presence of the prioress and convent and
others, secular folk : she knows not, however, as she sayS, whether the
said chaplain had been given licence in this behalf.

Darne Joan Pavy agrees with Alice Blytone.

Also she says that Margaret Ingoldesby, a secular woman, lies of a
night in the dorter among the nuns, bringing with her birds, by whose
jargoning silence is broken and the rest of the nuns is disturbed.

Dame Joan Fresshney says that the prioress suffers secular women,
both boarders and servants, to lie by night in the dorter among the
nuns against the rule.

The visitation was adj0urned until the octave of Michaelmas⁸ and to
any day on this side thereos.

Dame Alice Stayn says that all things are well.

Dame Sibyl Papelwyk says that the prioress is not impartial when
she makes corrections ε nay, to some she is over harsh, and to some over
kind and indiscreetly partial.

Also she says that [the] prioress is of no account in the governance
of matters temporal, nor does she care whether they prosper or not, but
she wholly disposes to her own use, as though they were her own, even
the common goods of the house.

2 The scapular was obligatory in time of work by cap. 55 of the rule of St. Benet.
Ducange defines it as ‘monachorum vestis propria cum labori et operi insistebant, loco
cucullae, ut quae brevior esset et minus ampla, et caput tamum et. scapulas tegens.’
