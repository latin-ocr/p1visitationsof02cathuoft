stroke of three on the clock after nones to exhibit the title of the
confirmation of his electiori and his 11131311311011.3 He shewed also the
state of the house ; and thereafter upon examination he says these things
which follow.⁴ At the which term, albeit he appeared in person,
nevertheless he displayed nothing concerning the confirmation of his
election or his installation, nor professed himself ready to make such
exhibition as regards aught forthwith or for the future. Therefore the
said reverend father took no order to exact his obedience, in that 116

that he might know after what sort observance was kept as regards
religion and other matters, he proceeded to his preparatory inquiry in
the samefhis visitation.

Brother William Sadyngtone‚⁵ the abbot.

Brother John Hynkeley, the prior, says and prays that the number
of the canons should be increased.

(Belgrave.) Also he says that brother Thomas Belgrave has been
excused quire by reason of the bodily weaknesses wherewith he is
oppressed and lies in the infirmary, and he receives all advantages even
as the other canons who observe the burthens of quire and religious
discipline, even as regards 011113,6 and abides in the infirmary.

Also he says that they who are undergoing their seynies have their
board with the abbot.

(The abbot.) Also he says that the abbot comes to quire only when
he performs the office, and he lies in his chamber within the d01·ter.⁷

Also he says that every canon receives five marks in the year.

(Wygstone.) Brother John Pomery‚ the sub-prior and master of the
novices, says that Wykyngstone has been cellarer for five years and that
he has made his reckoning for the first two years and is still to account
as regards the last three years.

(The 3111101.) Brother John Sadyngtone‚ :the cellarer, says [that]
there are few who keep quire, not counting the officers who are absent
and: thei ministers ot the altar and the othersgthat are in vestments, the

 

is another Yorkshire name. Seytone is most likely Seaton in Rutland. Prestone is too
general to be identified with probability. Buttre and Grene are not place-names. Pomery
was doubtless a member οἱ 1116 noble family of that name : a contemporary, Thomas
Pomeray, perhaps a brother, was an illegitimate son of 3 married nobleman (Cal. Papal
Letters VIII, 640) and was a monk of Westminster, holding several successive obediences, c.
1422-47 (Pearce, The Monks of Westminster‚ 1916, p. 138).

⁶ l.e.‚ he received the ordinary distributions payable to canons who attended obits in
quire, although he was a permanent absentee.

⁷ The buildings of Leicester abbey have disappeared, with the exception of a portion of
the gatehouse and such of their remains as were built up in an Elizabethan mansion, now
ruined, in the north part of the site. A post-suppression survey, temp. Henry vul, printed
in Archoeol. Journal xxvu. 205—6,⁵;shews that the abbot's lodging, with its hall. great dining
chamber‚‘fair lodging chamber’ and ‘inner chamber’ formed part of the buildings of a
square court east of the cloister‚ which appears to have been on the north side of the
church. This lodging may have been built aster 1440: the abbot’s chamber, however,
probably was at the end next the rere-dorter, as in Cistercian houses, where this position
was held from an early period-220 comply with the rule that the abbot should sleep in the
dorter with his brethren. This arrangement would cover the statement in the text. It
seems from the present visitation that the buildings had been largely reconstructed by abbot
Sadyngton during his rule.
