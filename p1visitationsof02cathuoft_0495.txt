twenty shillings that he might have his share in the profits of the
chantries and obits.

(The abbot.) Also he says that they were wont to have in the
infirmary a yeoman and a serving-man to do service at the costs of the
house to the canons in their ailments, and now they have only a boy,
insomuch that, when the canons are ailing, no help is given them in
their needful wants in the abbot's default.

Brother Thomas Wakefelde, the sacrist, says as above [concerning]
Robert and Thomas ; concerning the scarcity of canons as above.

Now when these had been examined, the same reverend father
adj0urned his visitation in the state wherein it then was until the Mon-
day next following in the morning,l there being present the abbot, dan
John Wyt1y² and the other canons of the place and I Colstone, and he
commanded me, the notary, to examine those who had not been

the abbot will not give leave to the canons when they ask that they may
go to the New college at times when indulgences are offered3 for the
purpose of obtaining the same.

(The abbot.) Also he says that the abbot makes himself much of a
stranger from his brethren and looks on them very despitefully and with
a sour visage, and will not speak to them but passes them by disdain-
fully 3 and, whenever they sit at board with him during their seynies, 116
is not courteous to them, nor does he converse with them at table, but
only with the secular folk that serve him, and in this wise he treats them
not as brethren or sons, but as though they were unknown to him and
strangers.

(The abbot. 7th.) Also he says as above concerning the multiplier,
and that the abbot, as it is said, has practised incantations 3 and he {ears
that after my lord's visitation the abbot will upbraid the canons on
account of the matters disclosed in the visitation, and will mete them
out harder treatment in his corrections after the visitation, for he has
been wont so to do after the ordinaries' other visitations.

Brother.Thomas Prestone says as above concerning the multiplier.

(The abbot. 13th.) Brother Thomas Asty [says] that, since the
abbot, on account of certain monies of his that had been taken, charged
his brethren generally in chapter with the accusation that one of them
had them, and no orie confessed to this, he took a boy, after an incanta-
tion had been made by him, and, having smeared the boy's thumb-nail,
made his incantations, gazing upon the nail, and came thereafter to
chapter, and, having called the brethren together, accused a certain
canon, this Asty, of having stolen such monies and so defamed him of
theft ; and although in confession this Asty shewed his wish to be pro-
claimed as innocent in this matter, the abbot would not believe him and
refused to absolve him, but rose up in anger and went away, and after-
wards revealed this Asty's confession in respect of the other matters
which he had confessed, because he said that he would complain to the

Sunday‚ known as Relic Sunday‚ as appears from the record of Longland's visitation in

'II-525. Hence came the dedication of the existing hospital in the Newarke to the Holy
rinity.
