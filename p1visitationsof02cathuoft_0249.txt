ELsHAM PRIORY, 1440 88

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the prior and convent of the priory of Elsham, of the
order of St. Austin, of our diocese, who now are and shall be, health,
grace and blessing. When some time ago we were visiting you and your
priory aforesaid, and were anxiously making inquiry concerning the state
thereof, we found there nothing at all which should smack of your order
or regular observances, but only the sign whereto that which is marked
with it answers not. For the reform therefore of religious discipline,
which is almost [dead] in that place, we despatch to you these our in-
junctions, to be observed by γοα, as far as in you lies, without breach.

In the first place, since in the said priory there are only four canons
beside you the prior, of whom two only seem to be capable of learning
and have not yet been taught in the rudiments or in the ruleS, we enjoin
upon you the prior, in virtue of obedience and under pain 'of grievous
contempt, that within at any rate you do make provision of

’ a fit man who is learned in such branches of knowledge and in the rule,

to instruct and teach the said canons zealously in the same branches of
knowledge and the rule.1

Also we enjoin upon you the canons all and several, under pain of
imprisonment for half a year, that you obey your prior with lowliness
according to the regular observances in all and through all things, and
your instructor appointed by him to this end in such things as may
appertain to him, and with regard to learning such elementary branches
of knowledge and regular observances ; and that each one be beforehand
in reverence and honour with his neighbour according to the rule 3 and
that no one of you do vex another with chidings, taunts, upbraidings or
cursings, but, if any grievance shew itself among you, let it straightway
be referred to the prior, that he may correct and cure the default and
the transgressor according to the rule.²

Also, as ye have food and raiment, be content with them, not hanker-
ing after dainties, seeing that ye have made public profession of voluntary
poverty, obedience and chastity therein.⁸

Also we enjoin upon you the canons abovesaid all and several, under
the penalties written above and below, that no one of you do in any wise
go outside the bounds of cloister or have access to the offices of the
priory, save with leave of the prior asked or had, or [unless] he be sent
by the prior for some business of the house; the which when he has
dispatched, let him return at once to the cloister.4

Also we enjoin upon you all and several under such penalties [as
follow] that you do utterly refrain from all drunkenness, surfeit and
gluttony3 and whosoever shall be caught in drunkenness, for the first
time let him fast the first Wednesday and F riday on bread and beer, for
the second time let him fast the first Wednesday and Friday thereafter
on bread and water, and for the third time let him fast every Wednesday
and Friday for onemonth next following continuously, and so with the
aggravation of the fault let the penalty also be increased.⁵

Also we enjoin upon you the prior, under pain of grievous contempt,
that you do correct and punish your brethren, when they transgress in
the regular observances or in divine service, indifferently without respect
of persons, so that the penalty of one may make the others afraid‚⁶

Moreover we admonish you. etc.

⁵ Founded on the prior's first and Hede's second ἅείειῑιιηιῑ
⁶ No complaint against the prior's conduct to the canons is reported, but the bishop
may have reeognised that he was inclined to lay too much stress upon Yorke’s misdoingS.
