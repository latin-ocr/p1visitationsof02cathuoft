college by Redburne and his servants, says that in the time of the master
who died last, on a day whereof he has no recollection, this sworn wit-
ness together with Richard Pyryelle met one Robert Wodale‚ serving-
man of sir Walter Muskham, late fellow of the college, now dead, who
was carrying the head and hind-quarter of a sucking-pig and a dish of
roast vea13 and this same interrogate asked of the said Robert whither
he was carrying the said meats, and he answered, to Redburne's house,
” for there he intended, as he said, to sup with his wife. And he says that
within these fourteen days Helen, the said Redburne’s serving-woman,
made known to this sworn witness that she never had victuals from the
college unless they were delivered by hand.¹ And more or otherwise
she knows not to depose, as she says.

Now, when these witnesses had been thus examined and their say-
ings and depositions put down in writing, and when there had been
called together before the same reverend father, as he was sitting on and
in the same day and place in his capacity of judge in the same business
as a tribunal, the master and fellows aforesaid, the said John Redburne
also having been called and being present, the same reverend father
published the sayings and depositions of the witnesses aforesaid in the
presence of the said John Redburne and read them and caused them to
be read publicly in the vulgar tongue; and thereafter he asked of the
said Redburne whether he has any proposition or exception to make

⁴ , against any of the witnesses aforesaid or the sayings or depositions of

them or any one of them. The same Redburne says that, as regards the
witnesses brought forward against him touching the defamation of the
college or of. any several person of the same, he has nothing to say,
propound or except against them or any one of them or their sayings,
save William Puttenham, brother in the flesh of sir John Puttenham,
fellow of the said college, who is the chief setter-on of all these things
against the same Redburne, on whose behalf he says that he believes that
the same William's deposition is more bitter against the same Redburne for
the favour he bears to the said sir John his brother, in order that he may
get the more complete victory, and also by reason of the quarrels begun
of old and continued between the same William and the same Redburne,
because that the same Redburne asked of the said William re-payment
of the monies which the same Redburne sometime lent to the same
William, nor could he get them, and so divers times they broke out into
words of dudgeon ; and save Joan, the wife of the same William, who
also had been brought forward as a witness and examined, against whom
he brings exception, saying that she had deposed against him on this
wisc, that her husband's brother might get the victory, and by reason of
the quarrels between the said William, her husband, and the same Red-
burne for the cause abovesaid. And as regards the removal or consump-
tion of the food of the college, he prays of the said reverend father that
he may be able to clear himself touching this with the officers and
servants of the college who have the keeping of such victuals, of the
which he himself had not the keeping, to wit with the cook, the butler,
the baker and the maltster of the said college. And to display and prove
his innocence and fealty in this behalf more clearly, he prayed of the
said reverend father that he might be able to bring before the presence
of the same reverend father the purveyors of victuals in the town of
Fotheringhay, of whom he buys bread, beer, flour for baking, malt for
