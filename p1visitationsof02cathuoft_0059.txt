INTRODUCTION li

When the rough draft was completed, it appears to have undergone
revision from another hand. This is not always apparent, but several
copies of injunctions have passages cancelled by another pen than that
of the registrar and marginal notes and interlineations made in a faint
and somewhat coarse handwriting, with a peculiar and somewhat old-
fashioned system of abbreviation. It is doubtful whether this is the
bishop's own hand ε it is far more likely that it is that of his chancellor,
John Depyng, his almost invariable companion at visitations, and some-
times, as at Legbourne (no. XXXIX), his commissary.

The Alnwick MS. thus displays clearly what injunctions mean, and
proves, if any proof is necessary, that they were founded directly upon
evidence derived at the visitation. It has been argued by those who
cling to the merely formal theory that, where we find injunctions in

J registers without the detecta with which they can be compared, no

conclusions can be drawn with regard to the special application of their
contents. If this is so, it may be asked whether there was any point in
preserving the inJunctions, which in this case would be a mere useless
repetition, alien to the purposes of a register, of what had been written
again and again. Only one set of injunctionS, of which no rough copy
survives, remains in Alnwick’s register 3 but, if fair copies of the injunc-
tions in the visitation MS. had been made, there is little doubt that the
MS. itself would in process of time have been destroyed, in common with
countless other notes and drafts of documents from which the material of
the register was selected. And if, by some fortunate chance, the minutes
of F lemyng’s and Gray’s visitations had been preserved, it can hardly be
questioned that we should find in them abundant evidence for the
contents of injunctions whose general similar'ity will be found, upon
closer examination, to be merely superficial and to be actually subject to
variations made with a special purpose.

The light which these visitation documents throw upon one of the
most interesting aspects of mediaeval life is singular-ly full and varied,
and to endeavour to analyse thern fully here would take up too much
room and would claim from the reader an attention which the text itself
demands without further comment. There is, however, one important
question to which the text only implies an answer. How far, alike from
the bishop's own point of view and in general, were these visitations,
conducted with such thoroughness and followed up by stringent injunc-
tions worded with peculiar care, of lasting effect upon the life of the
monasteries and secular colleges concerned ?

An example of the problem in question may be taken from the great
abbey of Peterborough, which, with the exception of Ramsey, was the
largest and most plentifully endowed religious foundation in the diocese.
Gray's injunctions of 1432 shew that the house was in need of reform as
regarded its general management. Its moral condition was satisfactory :
while it was found necessary to issue an injunction against the admission
of women to the cloister, this was couched in the briefest terms and
without that stress which would have been laid upon an order which
was more than precautionary.l Such things had happened : they

 

¹ It should be noted that, in such monasteries as Peterborough, where there was a
coustant call upon the hospitality of the abbey, the difficulty of preventing secular visitors
of either sex from making a thoroughfare οἱ the cloister must have been considerable.
