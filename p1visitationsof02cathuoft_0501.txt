canons than you have at the present time shall be able to be maintained
in seemly wise and without want out of the goods of your said monastery
to serve the Lord therein, we straitly enJ'oin and command you the abbot,
in virtue of obedience and under the penalties written beneath, that with
all convenient speed, and at the very least within the three years next
and immediately following, you shall take order to increase the number
of canons which now is to the number of thirty and [so] maintain it
continuall ‚¹

Also {vhereas in the almonry of the said monastery boys were wont
to be bred and nurtured out of the alms of the said monastery up to a
large number, of whom certain who deserved well were-chosen to be
canons of the same monastery and grew up to be persons of weight and
of mark, we enjoin and command you the abbot, under the same penal-
ties, that you take order to receive and admit into your said almonry
with all the speed you may, without demand of presents or of any goods
whatsoever, even if they be freely offered, or [without] favour beyond
measure, boys that are capable, serviceable and teachable‚ to the number
of sixteen at least, to be maintained out of the alms of the same monastery
after the praiseworthy custom thereof, who shall mind nothing else but
their learning and their service in church.²

Also, seeing that they shall make little profit in the other parts of
knowledge who have not tasted the elements of its beginnings, we strictly
enjoin and command you the abbot, under such penaltieS, to delay in no
wise to make provision of a serviceable teacher, who shall instruct and
learn your younger canons and the boys of your almonry in grammar
and the other elementary parts of knowledge at the costs of the
monastery.⁸

Also we enjoin upon you the abbot, under pain of suspension frorn

monastery aforesaid, that every year henceforth, between the feasts of
St. Michael the archangel and St. Martin in the winter, you do render

before the whole convent or such persons as the more part of the convent
shall think fit to elect and appoint for this purpose, a full, clear and faith-
ful account or reckoning of the entire administration of all such goods
not only of those which fall beneath the cellarer's administration‚ but
also of such as concern the offices of the sub-cellarer, sacrist [and]
chamberlain and of the granges and goods received outside the house
and also of the arrears of the accounts which have gone before, so that
the convent may be clearly assured of the state of the monastery, and
that an auditor of experience and skill herein be charged with the
auditing and closing of such accounts and reckonings.⁴

Also we enj0in upon you the abbot, under pain, beside the penalties
written above and below, of your final deprivation and perpetual removal
from your dignity of abbot, that you sell, give, grant or assign, upon any
