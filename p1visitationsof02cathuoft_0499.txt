if he could levy what was in arrear after his audit, the abbot is minded,
after the rendering of such account, to put all such arrears in his own
pocket and to answer for them no further.

Also the revenues of the house on a net receipt are worth ,5780
yearly, over and above the profits that come of the management of its
affairs, which is worth at least six hundred marks and upwards thereos
yearly 3 and all these things the abbot hides, etc.. that he may put more
in his own pocket.

Now, when all these had been examined, the same reverend father
caused the abbot and convent of the same place to be called together
before him in the chapter-house of the same monastery, and when they
thus appeared before him in person, as he was sitting in his capacity of
judge in the business of such his visitation, on the fourth day of the said
month of December, in the year of our Lord 1440 aforesaid, the same
reverend father made public the matters disclosed and discovered in this ,
preparatory inquiry of the visitati0n3 and, having laid to the abbot’s
charge such things as coneerned his person and having heard his answers
to the same, the same reverend father of his grace admitted the same
abbot to his purgatiori on his own unsupported oath touching the guilt of
divination charged against him ; and so he cleared himself of that guilt.
And then, saving and reserving to himself the power of making and
despatching to the same abbot and convent his canonical injunctions and
mandates according to the requirement of such matters disclosed and
reported, the same reverend father dissolved such his visitation.

 

 

william, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the abbot and convent of the monastery of blessed Mary
of the meadows in Leicester, of the order of St. Austin, of our diocese,
that now are and shall be, health, grace and blessing, and that ye may so
run your course that ye may obtain the everlasting prize. Inasmuch as
we ought by all means to cherish holy religion where it is planted, in no
case do we fulfil this better than in taking order by the authority com-
mitted to us to nourish those things which are right and to correct those
which hinder the advancement of virtue. In consideration therefore of
these things, we came down that we might see if all things be right
among you, even as we have charge, and, while performing the office of
our visitation in the monastery, found certain matters which, albeit not
many, are nevertheless worthy of reform. These therefore our lawful
and canonical injunctions and mandates for the reform of such matters
as we found we despatch to you to be observed without breach.

In the first place, seeing that the said monastery is endowed with
abundant and noble possessions, so that, after careful examination of the
resources of the same and its profits and outlay, a far greater number of
