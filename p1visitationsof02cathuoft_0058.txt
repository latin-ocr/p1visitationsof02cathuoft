which have led to the theory that they were purely formal documents.
Their formality, however, as has been shown, is a formality of
composition only: they had their definite meaning and application for
the several houses to which they were addressed, and to the bishop and
the registrar who took the trouble to copy and preserve them they were
of special use as a source of reference for inquiries at the next visitation
of each of the monasteries concerned. Sometimes, indeed, where a
preamble or certain injunctions intended for one house were re-used
word for word in the injunctions sent to another, the clerk, as in the case
of Huntingdon priory‚ already mentioned, did not find it worth his while
to copy them out more than once in full for his own use, but was
content with a reference to the document in which he had given
the whole text ; but it is almost needless to say that in the sealed copies
transmitted to monasterieS, such clauses were fully written out without
references which could not be understood where the corresponding
documents were not ready to hand. Moreover, copies of injunctions in
registers are fair copies made from a rough draft. The great value from
this point of view of the injunctions in the Alnwick MS. is that they are
the rough drafts themselves, full of corrections and interlineations which
show the amount of trouble and thought which went to their con-
struction. In this edition of the MS. these emendations have all been
carefully noted. Interlineations have been printed in itafics, while
cancelled words and clauses have been recorded in the footnotes ; and
the careful student who compares thern with the detecta in each case will

readily discover the method of their composition.

The registrar, in fact, who was their actual author, kept before him
the delecta and his common forms, and fitted the language of the second
to suit the requirements of the first. In the case of a long series
of detecta he was helped by the marginal notes and other devices which
have already been described, such as the brief reminderfiat iniunccio or
the occasional employment of numerals in the margin. VVhere, as at
Gracedieu, he had drawn up a list of the confzperta, this served as
the useful basis for the injunctions. He then set to work with his
common forms, comparing them with the evidence of the visitation,
using their normal wording as closely as possible, but leaving out words
or phrases where they seemed inapplicable to the case in hand, and
making additions or amplifications where they were needed. His plan
was not always uniform. Sometimes the injunctions were composed in
general terms without particular references3 sometimeS, as in the
elaborate series for Ramsey abbey, the evidence on which they were
founded was summarised at some length 3 occasionally he departed from
general mandates to include special offenders by name, a system which
indicates, as has been said, less careful composition ; in one instance
(no. vll), he was content to endorse an earlier set of injunctions, adding
merely a paragraph which alluded to a special case. But, whatever form
they took, the injunctions clearly refer to the evidence produced and
sifted at the visitation ; and, only in a few unimportant cases, do they
mclude matter for which ground will not be discovered in the delecta.
When such cases are examined‚ it will usually be found that they are

merely portions of injunctions which are regarded as habitual corollaries
to the main subject involved.
