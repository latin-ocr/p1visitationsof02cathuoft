lord william, by the grace of God bishop of Lincoln, against John Red-
burne, surveyor of the lodging or household of the college of Fothering-
hay, of the diocese of Lincoln, touching the consumption and taking-off
of the victuals of the same college done by the same John, as is averred,
was made in the chapel of blessed Mary of the said college, on the 24th
day of the month of September, in the year of our Lord 1438, by the
reverend father beforesaid, while in the act of visiting the college both in
its head and in its members by his right as ordinary.

Ellen, house-servant in the household of John Redburne of Fother-
inghay by the space of three years, having her origin in Little Stukeley,l
of eighteen years of age and upwards, of free estate and good report, as
she says, admitted as a witness, sworn and diligently inquired of whether
she ever carried out bread, beer, raw, roast or boiled flesh or other food·
stuffs, and especially, yesterday week, one breast of mutton and three
pigs' heads in her lap or c[ow]che, from the college to the said John
Redburne's house, of the delivery of Redburne himself or at his bidding,
either when the same Redburne dwelt at Warmington or after he took
up his abode in Fotheringhay, says straight out no, with this exception
only, that, when the same Redburne dwelt at Warmington, this witness
many times came from Warmington to Fotheringhay with eggs and
poultry for the use of the college, walking in the water² up to her knees,
sometimes to her buttocks, and then John the cook, without Redburne's
knowledge, gave her a mouthful of beef, mutton or salt pork to eat, and
in no wise for the use of her master Redburne or his wife. And she
further says that she has oftentimes heard Redburne forbid John Coke
and the other officers of the college to take any of the victuals of the
college to the said Redburne's house. She says moreover that every day
this fortnight sir John Toune, fellow of the college, has importuned this
witness, promising her a new tunic and forty pence, to the intent that
she might hold with him and his fellows, to bear witness against Red-
burne as regards the premises ; and that master William Appultone said
to this witness, in the hearing of sir John Palmer, that, had it not been
for him, Redburne would have been in his dust ere that day. And to
this Palmere said, ‘I too have helped to save his lifes And the said
Appeltone said over again, ⁴ Had it not been for me, he would have been
in his dust ere now, and haply will be ere long.' She says further that the
said sir John Toune said this day week to this witneSS, ‘You shall be
taken from your service and shall be with Wyngrave’s wife, and there
you shall have a good bed to lie in, and on Tuesday you shall be before
the bishop ; and when this affair is over, you shall have ten shillings in
your purse, and your tunic and forty pence, and after this affair is over,
you shall go free to Stamford³ or wherever you wish.’ And she
says that the same John T unne came to her last Monday afternoon, and
importuned her to be on his and his fellows' side against the said Red-
burne, adding that he would not have her fail them herein for twenty
marks. She has not been taught [what to say] nor has she been cor—
rupted by prayer, reward, hatred‚ fear or favour.
