xxx INTRODUCTION

Thomas Twyer, rector of Easton¹. And the opinion of the
majority of these as to what is to be done shall prevail, if any
difference, which God forbid, should arise among them respecting

the execution of the present testament and whatsoever codicils I

shall make ; and that shall prevail which shall be done or ordained

by the more part, provided it does not come in the way of my
present will.

In witness of all which things Ι have sealed this my present
testament, containing my will, with my seal of hand and have made
it close under my great seal as bishop. Given at Buckden on the
twelfth day of October in the year of our Lord 1445. .

Also I bequeath to Agnes, my brother's daughter, the relict of
Richard Haytone, twenty pounds 3 and to N. their daughter, twenty
pounds, if she be not married in my life-time.

If the official documents of his episcopate allow us little personal
intercourse with Alnwick, his will at any rate gives us positive evidence
of a high rectitude of character and a strong business capacity which his
official acts do no more than suggest. The personality which it reveals
is that of a prelate who, amid the religious decline and political confusion
of his age, maintained worthily the traditious bequeathed to the see of
Lincoln by St Hugh, Robert Grosseteste, and John of Dalderby.

Apart from the series of records contained in the following pages
and documents of a kindred nature printed in Bradshaw and Words-
worth's Lincoln Cathedral Statutes? the evidence for Alnwick's general
administration of his diocese is rather scanty.

His register, from the biographer's point of view, is 311 unsatisfac-
tory volume. It is in the nature of such a register, which is a book of
precedents, not a consciously compiled legacy to the historian, that it
should contain only a comparatively small selection from the bishop's
official correspondence, together with such memoranda as were neces-
sary for reference. Records of institutions and ordinations were kept,
not for the sake of the industrious antiquary, but to furnish evidence in
the case of a disputed presentation or a doubtful title. Such letters,
selected from Alnwick’s register, as are printed in the present volume
were preserved, not because the registrar felt a special interest in the
attempt of a nun to leave Gracedieu priory or in the monk of Bardney
who had successfully undertaken the administration of the declining
abbey of Humberstone, but because, when next a monk or nun requested
to be transferred from one religion to another, and when the next case
arose of an obedientiary of one monastery taking charge of another for
an extension of time beyond his original appointment, the model for the
necessary correspondence could be looked up in the register and found
