commands we despatch to you, to be observed by you without breach,
so far as concerns every one of you.

In the first place we enjoin upon you all and several, under the
penalties written beneath, that, at any rate if you be sound in health and

be present in person at matins, high mass and the other canonical hours,
reading, singing the psalms and chanting even as such hours require.4
