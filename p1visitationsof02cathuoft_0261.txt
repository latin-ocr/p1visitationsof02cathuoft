his fenows. And then he cleared himself with sir John Palmer, John
Brownyng and John Puttenham, and then my lord warned the same sir
Richard¹ according to the form of the statutes that henceforth he should
not haunt the conversation or the house of the said Emmot.

Also he says that sir Thomas Nortone has been defamed of long time
with the wife of John Barbour ; and by reason of these two follows the
whole college is defamed and so has been for these sixteen years and
more. But he says that this Thomas does not haunt the said woman’s
house so much as he was wont, since the master himself warned him to
leave her. He appeared and confesses that he has been defamed with
the said woman for twenty years : yet he denies his guilt. He confesses
that he haunts the said woman's house, but with a fellow and in honest
wise ; and he has to clear himself with three of his fellows. And he
cleared himself with Palmer, Appultone and Toune, and was warned ac-
cording to the form of the statutes that henceforth he should not haunt
that woman's dwelling under pain of expulsion from the college.

Also he says that at the time of his entry the college, as he believes,
was ,g 107 in debt and more.

Also he says that these who are thus leagued together, because he
will not [hearken to] their desires, in driving Redburne contrary to jus-
tice out of the college, without proofs and cognisance of the case, but
only according to their bare allegations with nothing more, are very
rebefflous, disobedient and abusive, in that they call him idiot.

Also sir John Toune, perpetual fellow, is publicly defamed with
Margery Veys, wife of Junior Veys, whom he brings oftentimes at his
pleasure into his chamber within the college, and that generally in the
absence of the master, when he is away on the business of the college ;
and, when the master is present, he has public access to the same woman
in suspect places. The article having been laid to his charge, he denies
his guilt at any time; but confesses that she has been with him in his
chamber, but not when they two have been by themselves. Wherefore

he made simple abjuration of the said woman and all suspect conversa-
tion with her, and was warned, etc., to keep this his oath under pain of
excommunicat-ion.

Sir William Typpe, the precentor, says that it is said that John Red-
burne consumes flesh and fish from the commons of the college to the
great damage of the commons of the college.

Also he says that there are certain of the college who do not attend
quire according to the statuteS‚² although they could do so well enough.

Also he says [that] oftentimes the bell for the hours is rung too late,
for the which cause the divine office is sung too quickly without the due
pauses⁸ and almost without devoutness.

Also he says that the fellows and choristers roam by themselves
outside the college into the town, and without a fellow, contrary to the

{atutesf even as also he himself, the precentor, oftentimes has done and
