THE VISITATION OF THE COLLEGE oF HIGHAM, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPEL oF THE sAME COLLEGE⁶ ox THE FIRST DAY OF JULY IN
THE YEAR OF OUR Lom) 1442. ΒΥ THE REVEREND FATHER IN
CHRIST AND LoRD, THE LORD WILLIAM ALNEWYK, ΒΥ THE GRACE
OF Gon BISHOP or LINCOLN, IN THE SIXTEENTH YEAR OF H1s
CONSECRATION AND THE SIXTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the fir'st place, as the said reverend father was sitting, on and in
the day and place aforesaid, in the beginning and accomplishment of the
business of such his visitation‚ there appeared the master, fellows and
other the ministers of such college, in readiness, as was apparent, to
undergo the visitation of the said reverend father. And then first and
before all else the word of God was set forth in the Latin speech, as was

¹ Founded on the third detecta of Alice Portere and Alice Leget respectively. The bad
effect of corrodies, among other inconveniences. upon the finances of the house at an earlier
date, is shewn by the preamble oi archbishop Zouche’s appropriation of Womersley chureh,
near Pontefract‚ to the convent (6 Aug„ 1348), summarised in Cal. Papal Letters v., 347.

2 Founded on Alice Portere's first detectum. ‘

⁸ Founded on the detectum furnished apparently by the prioress and on Alice Portere's
fourth detectum.

⁴ Wjaesen cancelled.

⁵ The chapel of the college, used also, as appears from this visitation, as a chapter·
house, formed part of the collegiate buildings. The fine parish church. although closely
connected with the foundation of the college, appears to have been reserved for parochial
services 3 but the fellows of the college appear to have served its altars, and probably the
fellows, clerks and choristers, occupied the stalls in its quire at high mass. The east range
of the college qmdrangle, containing its gateway‚ and a large portion of the south range,
with other fragments, still remain in the main street of Higham Ferrers, a little distance
N.W. oi the parish church and churchyard.
