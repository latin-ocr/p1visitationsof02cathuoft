DAVENTRY PRIORY, 1442 62

where he was then a monk, that he would pay all the debts which he
owed the same monastery in the various offices which he held aforetime.
He confesses that he took such an oath as in the article, and that after
the oath aforesaid and his installation he paid forty shillings to the
abbot of Peterboroughl who is now dead, and this out of his own allow-
ance and private fund.²

(Against the prior.) Brother John Daventre says that religion is
almost brought to ruin in the house

([Against] the sub· -prior ⁸) Also that the regular observances are
not kept, and the young monks run about at their will whither they like
within and without the priory, asking no leave 3 nor do they repeat their
services without book, as they are bound by the rule.⁴

([Against] all.) Also every monk keeps dogs on his own account,
by the which the alms of the house, as in the broken meat of the table,
are wasted.

([Against] the prior as above.) Also as regards the entry of the
prior this deponent on inquiry agrees with the sub-prior, and says further
that the bond was in the keeping of brother Richard StokeS, then sub-
prior, now prior of Totnes in the county of Devon,⁵ who delivered that
bond to those who were bound without asking the convent.

([Against] Daventre.) Also he says that brother William Daventre,
now the chamberlain and two years gone by the sacrist, did alienate two
silver cruets⁶ belonging to the altar of blessed Mary and another like
cruet, belonging to the sacristy. He confesses making away with the
cruets. He was warned under pain of excommunication to restore them
to the altar of blessed Mary on this side the feast of our Lord’s Nativity‚
and to restore that of the sacristy to that office on this side the feast of

, our Lord’s Nativity under pain of excommunication.

Also the monks do haunt the public wine and beer-taverns in the
town to the scandal and impoverishment of the house.

(Against the prior.) Also he says that women do come every day
in great number to the washing-places in the cloister, to the great scandal
of the house.

(Against the prior.) Brother William Daventre, the sacrist, says
that by reason of the prior's inactivity the temporal administration is on
the way almost to decay.

(Against the prior.) Also he says that the convent is ignorant of the
state of the house, in that the prior has never rendered an account,
although he has often been asked to do so. He confesses that he has
not rendered an account to the convent. Being interrogated if he has
anything to advance wherefore he should not be suspended from his
administration.⁷

(Against the prior.) Also he says that of custom the prior roams
by himself in the granges and gardens without his chaplain or any
attendant, concerning which men have evil suspicions, alleging that he
lives incontinently. He likewise confesses roaming by himself in the
orchards and gardens.
