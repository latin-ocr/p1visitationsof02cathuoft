xlvi INTRODUCTION

Bardney the whole of his first leaf for a general report, which he has
begun and continued at intervals until the end or temporary adjournment
of the visitation. The depositions at Peterborough begin upon the verso
of the leaf, at Bardney upon the next leaf.

These are in point of date the earliest documents of the whole
series, and the registi-ar did not long adopt this formal and orderly
arrangement, but began to enter his minutes in a more consecutive form,
of which an approximately perfect example has been given in the case
of Fotheringhay.¹ This had advantages for the purpose of reference, as
each part of the visitation now fell into its natural place ; but, as in the
case of the 1446 Peterborough document, part of a leaf may have been
used in the course of composition for memoranda, so that the record of
the continued process had sometimes to be squeezed in at the top or
bottom of the page, or divided between both. The visitation of the
Newarke college at Leicester (no. XL), the longest and fullest of all the
series, is a good example of the dislocation which ensued, when the
registrar had to crowd a very large amount of material into a very
limited supply of paper. He has spread his material over a certain
number of leaves: the evidence in a case of defamation, for example,
covers about two-thirds of one page, while the decree of deprivation
that followed is written at the top of another. The rest of the material,
however, including a long English petition from the inmates of the bede-
house and some supplementary injunctions, is added upon such parts of
the 'leaves as have been left vacant. In the case of the 1446 visitation of
Peterborough (no. Lx) the registrar had four blank leaves at the end of a
set of eight sheets to fill with his report ; but, when he came to the end
of his four leaves, there was still more to write, and he had to finish
upon a new sheet.

The composition of the documents has been thus explained. They are
summary minutes of visitations‚ made immediately or very soon after the
various stages of the process from notes taken in its course and from
documents which occasionally took the place of oral evidence. It has
been shown earlier that they have reached their present form by the
gradual filling up, at different times, of the quires of paper used by the

bishop's clerks, the blank pages of which have been utilised as occasion

demanded, so that no true chronological order has been preserved.

We have now to ask the more important question, what purpose did
they serve ? They were certainly not intended in the beginning to be the
mere historical record which in course of time they have become. The
plain answer is that their purpose was practical and that they served a
definite use at every point of the process which they narrate. They
formed the memoranda upon which the bishop and his clerks relied
to carry the visitation from stage to stage. But, the question of the
purpose which they served thus answered, there remains the further and
complementary question of how they served that purpose.

For the answer to this, it will be useful to look at a singularly
complete member of the serieS, the visitation of Gracedieu priory in
144o-1 (no. xxvm). This consists of the following parts : (1) rubrio and

with a prefatorysummary. The leaves immediately preceding have been lost, and it now
opens directly with the depositions of the abbot.
