 

HIGHAM FERRERS COLLEGE, 1442 136

accordant with the process about to take place, by the honourable master
John Beverley,¹ professor of holy writ, after this text, ⁸ My foot hath held
his steps,’ etc. And, when this had corneto a praiseworthy end, after
all had been removed whom this business did not concern, the master of
the college, to wit, master William More,2 delivered to my lord the
certificate of my lord's mandate which had been addressed to him in
this event, composed and sealed with the common seal of the college.
The which having been read through in public, and all having been
called over and making their appearance, the, master of the college,
whose obedience, as it had been proffered by him at another time, was
therefore not demanded at the present, exhibited nevertheless the letters
of his orders and his title in the college and vicarage,³ the foundation
charter and the state of the college. Sir Henry Drury, vice-warden‚ sware
obedience and made sufficient exhibition as regards his orders. Sir
William Blaunkpayn sware obedience and made exhibition. Sir John
Munde sware obedience and made exhibition. Sir Robert Hopekyn
sware obedience and made exhibition. Sir William Calvertone sware
obedience and made exhibition. Thereafter there appeared John Sher·
man, Robert Irlande, William Chiche and Walter Syngiltone, clerks, and
Thomas Lewes, Robert Offord, William Urlebat, John Spekke, John
Hyll and John Cresse, choristers of the said college. And after these
things my lord proceeded to the preparatory inquiry of the master and
fellows aforesaid3 who upon examination say these things which follow.

(Calvertone.) Master William More, warden or master of the said
college, says that sir William Calvertone, chaplain of the college, haunts
the house of Margery Chaumberleyne, tenant of the college, overmuch
and in manner suspect, and, after warning to desist, desists not. He
appeared and, the article having been laid to his charge, denies his
guilt3 and he was appointed to clear himself with four of his fellow
chaplains. And so he cleared himself with four of his fellow chaplains,
and was warned under pain of excommunication not to haunt the said
woman’s house or any other suspect places.

Also he says that it is a matter of necessity that the statutes of the
college be ordained anew, because those that have been ordained already,
what with their difficult and contradictory tenor and the scantiness of
the revenues of the house, can in no wise be observed.⁴

(The warden.) Sir Henry Drury, the vice—warden, says that the
fellows' salaries are not paid at the statutory terms, but [this is] not in
the warden’s default. ⁷

(The warden.) Also he says that, as it seems to him, the master is
slack in correcting the defaults of them that transgress in quire, the

 

 

Monasticon VI (3), 1424-6. The advowson of the parish church had been granted by Henry,
duke of Lancaster, to his college of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin in the Newarke
at Leicester, in pursuance of royal letters patent, 4 March, 1354—5, on 11 Oct„ 1355. It
was appropriated to the dean and canons of the Newarke college in Aug„ 1357, and a
vicarage ordained on 18 Jan., 1357-8 (Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reperts and Papers XXXII, 260-5).
By Chichele’s arrangement, the Newarke college did not lose the appropriationpr their
right of presentation to the vicarage; but the archbishop of Canterbury, on collating the
wardenship of Higham pleno jure, nominated the warden as vicar to the dean and canons
{f the Newarke, who presented him for institution to the vicarage by the bishop of
incoln.

⁴ No copy of the college statutes appears to exist. Of those relating to the hospital
there is a seventeenth-century copy in English ap. MS. Lansdowne, 846, ff. 77-79‚ summar-
ised in V.C.H. Norffiants, 11, 178-9.
