BARDNEY ABBEY, 1439-40 26

commanded and enjoined the same abbot and convent in virtue of
obedience and straitly gave them inhibition, that none of them inter-
meddle with the administration ot' such temporalitieS, nor in any wise
hinder the same Alan in such administration, but that, when the same
brother Alan is abroad on business about such temporalitieS, the said
abbot with the sub-prior and the chanter do cause the regular observ-
ances to be kept in that place; and that the several members ot the
convent do hearken to the said brother Alan in those things which
belong to such his office of coadjutor, even as they shall be fain to escape
canonical retribution.

While the abbot, the prior, the sub-prior, Waynflete and Bracy
stayed in the chapter-house, the rest having gone out, my lord rehearsed
to the abbot how no-one ought to be deprived except he be convicted ς
and, whereas the abbot laid divers offences to Bartone’s charge and
imprisoned him therefore, being unconvicted save of this alone, that the
imprisoned party called the abbot a thief . . .

At length, with the consent of the abbot and the remaining four and
ot almost all, the said brother Thomas was freed from prison and made
lowly submission to the abbot and besought pardon for all that he had
done. My lord ordained that he should be free from prison and that at
his meals he should abide in the infirmary with William Burghe; and
then my lord by his authority as ordinary warned the same Thomas not
to intermeddle with any or concerning any governance of the monastery
within doors or without, and to keep peace and concord, and to sow no
seeds ot brabbles henceforward among the brethren, under pain of per-
petual expulsion from the monastery in case that he be lawfully convicted
hereafter touching any of the premises, etc.

The abbot deposes that Langtofte the precentor, William Yorke,
Richard Parteney with two other of the younger monks, on Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday in the week after the invention of the holy Cross,
to wit in the month of May in the year of our Lord 14381, did take their
meals in the house of the almonry without the bounds of the cloister both
at midday and at supper, contrary to my lord's injunction made and noti-
fied to them under pain of excommunication. They confess the injunction.
They also confess they ate so together. They confess to have celebrated.2
Wherefore my lord declared them guilty of irregularity and to be irregular
person83 and they swore to obey the law and to observe this and the other
injunctions. He was absolved3 from the sentence of excommunication.

Also he deposes that silence is in no wise kept in cloister or in church
or anywhere else where it ought to be kept according to the order, and
on this account, [because when] they who transgress this are punished, the
penalty is so light that it is not feared and the offenders do not leave off.

Also he deposes that brother John Hole sent out privily all his
private goodS, with the mind and intent, as it appeared, to leave the house
in apostasy, and especially a silver spoon and a mazer garnished with
silver ; and yet he has not yet gone, norrwill he disclose to the abbot
where such goods are.

Also whereas my lord at another time had enjoined upon the abbot
