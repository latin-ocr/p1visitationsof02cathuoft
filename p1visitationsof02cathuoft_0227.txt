altogether restrained, and this under pain of the excommunication written
beneath,1 notwithstanding in aught the contrary custom, howsoever it
have been hitherto your wont, the which we reckon rather to be a
corrupt usage.²

Also we enjoin upon you the abbot and every one that shall succeed
you, under pain of the deprivation and perpetual removal of you and of
him from such the estate and dignity of abbot, that you do give, assign,
grant or sell to no person, howsoever honest, male or female, corrodies,
liverieS, pensions or annuities in perpetuity‚ for term of life or for a fixed
time, save for just and reasonable cause set forth by you beforehand to
us or our successors, bishops of Lincoln, and duly approved by us or the
same our successors, and with the special licence of us or such our suc-
cessors asked or had for this purpose beforehand, and also with the
compliance of the express consent of the whole convent or the sounder
and more part of the same hereunto.³

Also, seeing that the canons, according to the rule professed therein,
should go out of the monastery in no wise on foot or on horseback,
unless they be clothed in cloaks that are closed and not open, we enjoin
upon you all and several that now are and shall be, under pain of ward
in cloister for one month immediately following, so often as any one of
you shall transgress herein, that you do fully observe such your rule in
so going forth ; and that the canons who are in their seynies do not walk
about for their recreation by themselves but together, and so abiding
together do return together to the monastery, under the penalty next

ΓεΙίςίοζ, whereby the entire rgligious discipline 3in that place is almost
turned upside down, we therefore enjoin upon you all and several that
now are and shall be, under the penalties written above and beneath,
that henceforward such chambers be not appointed to any persons, at
any rate thatlare suspect, and that such doings be not held in the same,
lest the decency of the cloister or the stainlessness of religion or the
good report of the monastery or of the persons of the same be in any
way soiled hereby.⁵
