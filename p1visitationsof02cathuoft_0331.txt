GRACEDIEU PRIORY, 1447-8 129

Lord of Sabaoth at the canonical hours by day and night, while we also
patiently endure grievous cares fastings and watchings, and further are
instant together in contemplation, even as the holy Spirit deigns to give
us His inspiration. And the said Margaret Crosse, who is sufficiently
trained in such regular observances and is very needful for the service of
God in our priory aforesaid, if she be transferred to the said priory of
the nuns of St. Margaret aforesaid, wherein such regular observances and
contemplations are not so fully kept as in our aforesaid priory, in the which
also her sister according to the flesh [abides] as prioress,1 would give
herself to secular business in all matters rather than to such contemplation
or observance of the rule ; and thereout shall arise to us and our priory
not only grievous ill repute, for that it was never yet heard that a nun
departed therefrom, but also no small loss, especially in that such chant-
ings and regular observances would in likelihood suffer damage by reason
of the said Margaret's absence. Besides, the said Margaret Crosse has
caused and commanded certain goodS, property and jewels belonging to
our priory to be stealthily conveyed by certain of the said Margaret's
friends in the flesh from our priory to foreign and privy placeS, and to
such conveyance done in her name has lent her authority, with the
purpose, as is strongly suspected, of taking advantage of the darkness
one night, like an angel of Satan taking the form of an angel of light?
and transferring herself utterly and entirely of her own motion to places
wholly strange, without having or asking and against our will, incurring
sacrilege to her damnation herein and calling in vain upon the aid of the
law, since she commits her case to the law.³ And when these things have
been fully weighed by your lordship's fatherhood, the pleas which have
been submitted to you in this case on behalf of the said Margaret Crosse

VX do not contain the very or the full truth. Wherefore, seeing that the said

Margaret's wish to enter the said priory of St. Margaret is known not to
be of a pure heart and conscience and faith unfeigned, the said Margaret
may not be freely suffered by us to pass to the priory of St. Margaret
aforesaid with our licence under letters sealed· with our commonssseal, in
{2¹33ng oistssffifsstvgffiffi &¹533 ῗιῗὲθῷῂῗὲἐζῑίΐῗέἒέζῗῗ Ξῖὶᾝέἒῃὲῗξ
we certify to your lordship's fatherhood by these presents sealed with

. our common seal. Given in our‘chapter-house on the 26th day of the

month of January in the year of our Lord abovesaid.

¹ Eleanor Cross‚ prioress of St. Margaret’s, died in 1467. See Visitations 1, 157.

,Β The prioress and convent, who probably employed some iurisperitus to compose the
certificate, seem to referto the words of the decretal to which the bishop had alluded:
‘Srvero probabiliter dubitetur, utrum quis velit ad ordinem arctiorem aut laxiorem ex
cantate, an ex temeritate transire: superioris est iudicium requirendum, ne Jbrte angelus
satanae in lucis angelum se tranqfhrmet. ’

³ The obvious meaning is that the prioress and convent considered Margaret's request
to change her house a mere pretext for apostasy.
