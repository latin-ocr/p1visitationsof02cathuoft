¹ The identity of the countess of stafford in 1439 involves a slight difficulty. Hum-
phrey stafford succeeded his father Edmund 21 July, 1403, as sixth earl and seventh baron
of stafford, and was earl of stafford at his creation as K.G., 22 April, 14293 but after 16
Oct.‚ 1438, when his mother Anne, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock‚ son of Edward 111
and earl of Buckingham and Duke of Gloucester‚ and heiress of her brother Humphrey,

Buckingham. Their son Humphrey, who must have been a boy o fourteen at most in
1439, was styled earl of Stafford, but probably not till 1444. He married Margaret, daughter

1460 t the duchess Anne married, before 25 Nov„ 1467, Walter Blount‚ first baron Mount-
