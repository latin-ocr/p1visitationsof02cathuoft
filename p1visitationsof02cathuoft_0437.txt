LAUND PRIORY‚ 1440 182

nowise go out of the cloister precincts to visit such their offices before
they have said the canonical hours and say or hear their due masseS, and
that they return to quire, when their businesses are dispatched‚ with all
the speed they can, to do service with the others in divine worship.1

Also we enjoin upon you all and several, that now are and shall be,
under the penalties written beneath, that the common seal of the house
be kept in a chest under three locks of different ShapeS, of the keys
whereof the prior shall have one, the sub-prior another. and another of
the convent, to be chosen by the convent, the third ; and that no one of
such keepers do deliver his key to another for a sealing, save with the
consent of the convent; and, whenever there shall be aught to be sealed,
first let the business be fully discussed in chapter among all, and, as the
more and sounder part of the chapter shall agree, let these three keepers
meet and let such matter for sealing be sealed by view of them all.¹⁴³

Also we enjoin and command that with what speed you can the
defaults in the manors, granges, tenements, chancels and rectory-houses
of the churches appropriated to the house, and the other defaults that
are within the priory be repaired, lest by failure to repair they may come
to naught.³

Also we enjoin and command you who are now and every one that
shall be prior, under the penalties of disobedience and contempt and of
suspension from your administration, that you do no weighty business
nor lease any farms, except you first have held careful discussion with
the convent in chapter touching such thing, and with the consent of the
more and sounder part of the chapter agreeing hereunto ; and that every
year, between the feasts of the Annunciation of our Lady and the apostles
Philip and James, you render-in full a full and faithful account of all the
revenues of the house, its receipts‚ its paymentS, and of your entire
administration as regards the goods of the priory aforesaid in chapter
before the whole convent or such rnen as the convent shall appoint, so
that the convent may have clear certainty concerning the state of the
house.4

Also we enjoin and *command you who are now the prior and
everyone that shall come after you, under pain of your and his depriva-
tion and final removal from such your and his estate and dignity, that
from henceforth you do in no wise sell [or] grant corrodies, liveries,
pensions or annuities to any person whatsoever for a term of life, for a
certain time or in perpetuity, or fell or cut down copses which are old
and not meet for cutting, except with special licence of us or our
successorS, bishops of Lincoln, first asked and had, and with the consent
of the more and sounder part of the convent agreeing hereunto.⁵

We therefore admonish you all and several that now are and shall
