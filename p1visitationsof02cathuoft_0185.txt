· are professed ; and he says that two of his fellow monks are continually

maintained at their studies in the university of Cambridge.l

Brother Richard Fressheney, the prior, says that all things are well.

Brother Richard Croylande says that all things are well.

Brother John Frestone the elder says that all things are well.

Brother John Botheby says that it would be to the advantage oi
religious discipline and the profit of the house of Frieston² that the prior
of that place should continually wait there upon the charge of the said
house 3 for at present the prior of that place stays in the monastery,
whereby there is grievous fear of serious risk to that house in things
spiritual and temporal because of the absence os the said prior.

Also he says that the almoner should furnish two suitable horses and
the master of the work of the monastery⁸ other two suitable horses to
the different monks who hold different offices outside the house, when
they are about to ride forth to survey the tenements and possessions that
concern such lesser offices ; and now such horses are wanting, by reason
whereof and of the want of such supervision such tenements and posses-
sions are in danger oi dilapidation.⁴ He prays therefore that a remedy
be applied herein.

Also he says that in the office of the almonry there is a house which
is called the ⁴ syster house,'⁵ where ot' long accustomed wont there used
to be received and maintained the parents of the monks and the serving-

·· folk of the monastery, whenever they carne to old age and infirmity or by

ill chance happened on loss of vigour or any sort of wretchedness ; and ·

land two messuages in the parish of St. Giles, Cambridge, for the residence of Benedictine
monks studying canon law and holy Scripture in the schools (Cal. Pat„ 1422-9, p. 475). In
the settlement of this college or hostel, Croyland was joined by the monasteries of Ely,

χ Walden and Ramsey. From the benesactions of Henry Stafford, second duke of Buckingham

 

(d. 1483), the college took its name of Buckingham college. It was refounded in 1542, after
the suppression of the monasteries, by Thomas, lord Audley of Walden, as Magdalene
college. The buildings of the first court of Magdalene. though much rebuilt and altered,
are still in part those of the old monastic college. The roos of the chapel is that of the
chapel built by the second duke of Buckingham c. 1475, while the hall is substantially that
built in 1519 at the cost of his son Edward, third duke.

² For Frieston priory 566 Visitatzbns 1, 154. At Gray’s visitation (ibid. 1, 38) the prior
of F rieston seems to have been resident there, but the other monks were only six in number,
as now, so that Gray’s injunction to supply monks juxta numerum ficndacioms was evidently
disregarded. Seven monks gave evidence about Frieston at this visitation: it is probable
that some of these were monks of the cell, but others would be exempted from attending the
visitation at Croyland, as the services of the priory would have to be maintained. In
1437-8‚ prior Wessyngton of Durham, in his certificate of a visitation mandate addressed to
him by the archbishop of York's commissary‚ provided against the entire desertion of cells
by monks attending the visitation, stipulating ‘quod in singulis cellis tot remaneant monachi
pro diuinis officiis peragendis ac aliis necessitatibus et oneribus supportandis quot fuerint
necessarij et sufficere poterint’ (York Reg. Kempe, fo. 491).

⁸ For the magister operis or operum of a monastery see Visstastons, 1, 237. Opus in such
a case implies the fabric, as in many instances: cf. the novum opu, the Newarke or new
work, on the south side of the castle at Leicester.

⁴¹ In this case Gray’s injunction (ibina, 1, 37, 38) had also been disregarded. The
sacrist‚ almoner, chamberlain and cellarer at Ramsey were bound to a similar custom (ibid,
1, 10' 106 .

εξἸῐι cgnnexion with this curious title it may be noted that in Rites of Durfiam (Surt.

⁹ Soc.)‚ p. 92, it is said: ‘ Ther weare four aged women who lyved in the sarmery without the

south gaitis of the abbey of Durham euery one having ther seuerall chamber to ly in, being
founde and fedd onely with the releeie that came from the priors owne meys ⁸, etc. This
building, whose inmates were supplied with the prior’s alms, was close to the gatehouse and
almonry‚ and the description in officio elemosinarii, i.e. in that part of the monastery where
the almoner's duties lay, might be applied to it as well 35 to the ‘sister-house ’ at Croyland.
