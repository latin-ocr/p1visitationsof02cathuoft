BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-ss 18

endowed and it is necessary that [the sacrist] pay yearly to the abbot's
exchequerl twenty-six stone of wax, he that fills this office cannot so pay
the said wax and support the remaining charges that are incumbent upon
him. He prays therefore that help be given in somewhat to him that
fills that office : otherwise he must needs abandon it.

Brother William Croyland, the warden of the infirmary, says that
the monastery is able to spend 600 marks and is 400 marks in debt.

Also he says as above concerning the monks who are not fully pro-
fessed.

(Against all for the governance of the monastery.) Also he would
that my lord should appoint some means of governance for the monastery,
whereby it may be discharged of debt the quicker.

Brother Henry Lincolne, the guest-warden and fraterer, says that
the house is in debt in heavy sumS, and this by reason of the imprudent
governance of the Officers in former times.

(For the governance of the monastery.) Also he says that he sees no
way whereby repairs, which demand large sums, should be made, and the
monastery be discharged of debt, except a serviceable secular person be
appointed by my lord to have the whole governance of the monastery, in-
asmuch as the officers that are now, as Bartone and the rest, put into their
pocket the substance of the goods of the monastery ; and he says that the
household expenses were never so sparing as they are now and [yet]
their debt is ever growing, and the same officers do entertain others
very sumptuously, etc.

(Against Bartone.) Also he says that brother Thomas Bartone the
sub-cellarer, albeit he is not weak in body but well and strong enough,

κ does not lie by night in the dorter but in a chamber in the infirmary or

in his checker next the kitchen, and well-nigh every day he entertains
one Graystokxin his chamber in the infirmary, and this upon the more
dainty food in the kitchen3 and if any of his brethren complain, since
they are not so well [fed], he says with reviling that it shall be so in
spite of them.

(Against Bartone.) Also he says as above concerning certain dues
that are wont to be paid to the convent from the offices of the pittancer
and the almoner, which Bartone lately held, ancl have not been pald.

(Against the abbot.)² Also whereas before the time of the present
abbot the provision of wine stood every year at twenty pounds at least,
no wine has been bought during the present [abbot's] time, so that he
blelieves that, if this is continued, the monastery will be much succoured
t ereby.

Brother John Hale says that the debt whereby the monastery is
ἓξίῑὲιὲἳεῒὶεά comes of the ill governance of them who have been officers
1 (Against the abbot, Bartone.) Also he says that the abbot is of no
great account, but the same abbot is wholly ruled by brother Thomas
Bartone, who lays everything waste ; and he says that the same Bartone
ἱῖἔξοὲἲὸιῗὲΐ of all the bickerings in the convent and will be the ruin of
''(Againsty1}‚art0ne.) Also he says that the same Bartone defamed
this Hale [ot adultery] with the wife of the washerman of the monas-
tery, promising one man a new smock if he would keep his eyes open
