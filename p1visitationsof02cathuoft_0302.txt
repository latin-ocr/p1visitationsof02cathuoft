2 This name is barely legible. Alice Nunny became abbess in 1471 : see note 1 on
p. 114 above.

³ The first three injunctions were issued in response to the request of the abbess. lt
will be noted that the clause respecting the abbess which is added to the second was founded
upon the detectum furnished by Isabel Clyntone, but includes a recommendation to attend
matins sor which no reason appears in the evidence. The only positive evidence for corro-
dies, etc„ is the steward's yearly iee, vouched for by Amy Hardelle.
