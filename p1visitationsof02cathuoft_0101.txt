BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437·8 13

wishing, as he affirmed, to know how they should behave themselves in
these things which had been ordained, he adjourned such his visitation
until the fourteenth day of March now next to come, master John
Depyng, John Bug, Thomas T horpe and Ι Colstone being present. But
in the meantime, because the said reverend father was so much busied
and hindered by the business of his church of Lincoln and other business
which he might not avoid, that he could not come down to the place on
the said fourteenth day of March, he committed to master John Wylby,
skilled in the law, his part and office of adjourning such visitation and
such business until and unto the Wednesday then next to come, the
- nineteenth day, to wit, of the month of March, with adjournment, etc.,l
and of doing all else, even so as it is more fully contained in the letters
of commission [addressed] to him in this behalf. And he, taking such
burden upon himself and proceeding in this business according to the
form delivered to him, on the said Wednesday, to wit, the nineteenth
day of the said month of March, in the chapter-house of the said

· monastery of Bardney, as the same reverend father was sitting in judg-

ment as a tribunal on and in the same day and place and in such business
of his visitation, and the abbot and the several monks of the said
monastery, save one only that was sick, had appeared before the same
reverend father, did certify him of what he had done in this behalf by
means of letters under this form, ⁸ To the reverend father in Christ '‚ etc.
And when these letters certificatory had been read through, the same
reverend father recited the doings and acts previously performed by him
in the business of such visitation, and how he gave them the choice of
two ways for the good governance of the monastery in things temporal
and which of them they chose. He would know therefore, as he said,
wherein or in how much the monastery had been bettered by this way
that had been thus chosen and whether they all observed it duly without
grudging or hindrance. Touching this he first took counsel with the
abbot and thereafter with Bartone‚ who since the time of the choosing
of such way had the governance of the monastery as concerning meat
and drink; the which abbot and Bartone say that, if this way may be
pursued further, it will be to the great advantage of the monastery, for
by this, that every week they use in malt two quarters and in corn one
quarter less than their wont, the monastery is bettered, and by a large
sum of money in respect of the kitchen.² And then, when he had called
and inquired of them whether they will choose this or the other form of
life which had previously been proposed to them, they were content
with the one they had first chosen, saying that they will continue in the
same. And after this was done, my lord made them certain injunctions,3
warning them under pain of excommunication pronounced from now as
from then⁴ that none do eat or drink in the town of Bardney, and, under
pain of excommunication to be pronounced, that none do bring any
woman within the precincts or, if a woman be brought in by another, do
receive her into any familiar converse, etc., and that they keep themselves
from late drinkings and watchings after eight o'clock at night, and that
they rise to matins, etc., and concerning what else must needs be done
according to the requirement of the disclosures and discoveries in such
his preparatory inquiry, saying that he will make provision [of such in-
junctions] at a convenient time and send them under his seal in writing.
