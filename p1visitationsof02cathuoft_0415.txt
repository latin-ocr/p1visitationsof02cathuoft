KYME PRIORY, 1440 171

Brother John Mace, the cellarer and sacrist, being asked, [says] that
one who is the prior's chamberlain lies hard by the dorter: as regards
other things, he says all things are well.

Brother John Sotertone says that master Thomas Kyngtone will not
instruct the novices in grammar, unless he may have more for his pains

than the resources of the same novices can supply.1

’ Brother William Spaldyng says that the clerk of the monastery is
very neglectful and slack in his office, as in his ringing of the bells and in
his service at the altar and in other respectS.

Also he says that they have not a gate-keeper, by reason whereof the
gates sometimes stand open.

Brother William Bostone‚ who has wornthe habit in the same place
for a year,² says that master Thomas Kyngtone sometimes instructs him
and the brother his fellow in grammar : howbeit, he receives twenty
pence for his pains for a quarter of a year, and he says that their
resources are not sufficient for this charge.

Brother William Spaldyng is defamed with Margcry Wastnesse. He
appeared and, the article having been laid to his charge, denies his guilt;
wherefore a time was given him to clear himself with four of his brethren,
immediately after breakfast on the same day in the same place. At the
which time he appeared and cleared himself with the prior, Thomas
Marom, Thomas Blytone and John Mace.

Saving the power of making injunctions and commands, and having
reserved the penalty of this disclosure concerning fleshly lapse,³ my lord
dissolved his visitation, there being present Τ110111101164 and Skayman⁵
and I Colstone.

 

 

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved
sons in Christ the prior and convent of the priory of Kyme, of the order
of St. Austin, of our diocese, that now are and shall be, health, grace and
blessing. Inasmuch as [we ought by all means to cherish] holy religion
where. it is planted (eto, as above in the case of Croyland [down to]) to
be observed [ctc.]⁶

In the first place we enjoin upon you the prior, in virtue of obedience
and under pain of contempt, inasmuch as several of your brethren hold
more than one office within as well as without the house, in whose hands
[such offices] in both places [at once] speed not well, and by reason
thereof‚ let us not say of their own liking, they are drawn away from the
divine offices of the night and day, that, if it must be by all means that
one canon do hold two or more offices, 116 shall be set over such as are

Α ¹ This indicates that the novices paid their grammar master out of their peculmm. See

note on Peculium, Visitationsx, 243

² See note 2 on p. 15 above. The principle that a year ’5 continuance in the monastic
habit 1n one place constitutes tacita professio and obliges the novice to permanent vows is
laid down in Decretal 111, tit. xxxi, 6. 22, Ex parte tua. lbi l ,6. 2 9 Status· nus provides
that, where there 15 no distinction of, habit between novices and the expresse professi, the
habit given to religious when they make profession shall be specially blessed at the time.
These rules apply primarily to monks, but were intended, as in many similar cases, to be
binding on religious generally

3 l. o. the person who had brought the charge, the detegens, incurred a penalty.
