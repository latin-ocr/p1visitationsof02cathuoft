xlviii INTRODUCTION

injunctions by the registrar. Now and then special points were marked
by the insertion of the word nota in the margin. In any case, the detecta
were now distinguished for use, and, in the case of a long and compli-

cated visitation, could be easily sorted.
(3) The detecta, when sorted and sifted, became the basis for the

comperta, the matters discovered in the visitation. It cannot be
emphasised too strongly that the bishop is the recipient of the detectum,
while the compertum is a finding that rests upon his own judgment. In
practice, the detectum and compertum are often treated as if they were
identical, and the phrase quia detectum existit nobiS, used 'in injunctions,
is little more than a variant of quia compertum est a nobis. The
construction, however, explains the fundamental difference between the
two phaseS. At Gracedieu the comperta are noted at considerable
length, and should be compared with the detecta that precede them.

(4) The continuation 'of the process involved the publication of the
detecta and comperta before the whole convent. lndividual offenders
were then charged with the various offences of which they had been
accused, in the form of written articles which were read over to them
and which they were requested to answer. These articles, in the case of
Gracedieu, have been noted already: they were the comperta of the
visitation referring to individuals, and failure to meet them by the
process of compurgation incurred canonical punishment. In several
instances, separate processes, especially where serious defamation was
concerned, are recorded at great length : the alleged misdoings of one
of the canons of Irthlingborough (no. XXXIV), the apostasy of a nun at
Stamford (no. LXVIII), the difficulty of incapacitating abbot Assheton
of Peterborough without disgracing him (no. LX), lead to long narratives
οἱ the appointment and postponement of terms for the appearance of the
culprit, the result being sometimes obscure. Ordinarily speaking, the
answers of the accused to their charges were noted in the space
left between one detectum in which any particular charge was brought
and the next3 and details of compurgation, where it was required,
follow. Examples of this will be found in many places : the visitation of
Bardney in 1444 (no. v) and of Fotheringhay in 1442 (no. XX111) may be
cited. In these spaces between the detecta, moreover, are also notes of
the admonitions delivered by the bishop in certain cases pending
the delivery of injunctions, and not infrequently, in certain visitations‚
these occurs the note fiat iniunccio.

(5) The final act of the visitation was the composition and delivery
of injunctions. On this point and upon the significance of injunctions
the present editor has already laid some stress.1 But the evidence
which bishop Alnwick’s Visitation Ms. affords with regard to the composi-
tion and meaning of these documents is of a singularly important and
conclusive nature. It lays to rest the theory that injunctions were
common forms referring to nothing in particular, left like portentous
visiting-cards upon a convent to show that the diocesan had duly called.
Common forms unquestionably played a large part in their composition.
For the subjects with which they habitually dealt, recognised breaches
of the rule and of canon law. plenty of precedents were available ; and,
ready to the hand of Alnwick’s clerks, and probably compiled by Thomas
