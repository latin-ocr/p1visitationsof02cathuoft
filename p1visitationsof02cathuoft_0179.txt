COMM1ss10N To AUDIT THE ACCOUNT OF THE HOUSE oF THE
Nuus OF CATESBY.¹⁰

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved son
in Christ the abbot of the monastery of St. James by Northampton,ll of.
the order of St. Austin, of our diocese, health, etc. In our sometime
visitation by our right as ordinary of the priory of Catesby, of the order
of Citeaux, of the said our diocese, on account of certain lawful reasons
which impelled us in that behalf, we suspended the prioress ot that place
from all administration of the spiritual and temporal goods of the said
priory until such time as shall seem good to us, and committed such
administration to sisters Agnes Allesly and [Isabel] Benet, nuns of the
said priory. Now the same Agnes and Isabel have this day shewn us an
account of the administration performed by them. As we have no sure
knowledge of the rents and yearly incomings of the said priory or of the
charges that necessarily go out therefrom, we commit to you, of whose
distinguished diligence we have exceeding confidence in the Lord, by
these presents, that, after some like account of the administration of the
goods of the same priory, rendered of elder times, has been seen by yon,
you do audit and examine diligently such account, which we despatch to
you together with these presents enclosed under our seal, and, having

1 Interlined above the thrydde nunne cancelled.
²³ The rest added at the foot of the page, at a mark corresponding with one in the text.
³ Sic: for and. The mark of contractiori is left out.
⁴ See note 2 on p. 50 above.
⁵ of cancelled.
ὓ The rest in margin.
¹ ⁷ asyour rule wyll cancelled in margin. The first part of this injunction rests upon a
detectum of the prioress. juliane Wolfe and Alice Kempe supplied the detecta upon which
the second part is founded ; while the third part again depends upon the prioress's inform-
atron.
⁸ sele cancelled.
⁹ The bishop did not leave Catesby till the 18th, so that the injunctions must have
been composed at Yelvertoft the same night. Yelvertoft is about 14 miles N .E. of Catesby.
