xvi INTRODUCTION

that Alnwick was a Percy is by no means clear. It is not unhkely, per-
haps, that he may have been related to the lords of his native town, but
there is no evidence even for this. Nothing is known of his parentage z
the only surname by which he can be recognised is that of Alnwick,
which in itself tells us nothing. We know from his will that he had a
brother, whose daughter married a man named Richard Hayton, and
that this couple had a daughter ; but otherwise we have no glimpse of
his relatives. The probability is that Mr. Leach confused him with
William Percy, chancellor of Cambridge university 1451-5, and bishop of
Carlisle 1452-62, who was son of the second and brother of the third
earl. Possibly also he may have been misled into assuming a relation-
ship by the fact that, in the licence for the foundation of the chantry,
the name of William, bishop of Lincoln, occurs between that of Henry,
second earl of Northumberland‚ ancl that of his son and heir, sir Henry
Percy, lord Poynings.¹ This, however, is of course due to the arrange-
ment of the names in order of precedence of rank, and has nothing to
do with any relationship3 and Mr. Leach's statement may fairly be
dismissed as an incautious slip of the pen.

A second error, which has found its way into many books of refer-
ence, is the supposition that Alnwick was a Benedictine monk of St.
AlbanS. The origin of this theory appears to be the circumstance that
one William Alnwyk was prior of Wymondham in Norfolk, a cell of
St. Albans, in 142o.² It is obvious that this is a very slender ground for
his identification with the bishop. The name William Alnwick was
obviously common to many natives of Alnwick, just as in the present
series of visitations we find three several personS, a secular and two
monks, who bore the name of John Depyng,³ and a monk called William
Waynflete who was certainly not the famous bishop of Winchester.⁴
Moreover, the occurrence of such a name as Alnwick at St. Albans and
in its cells is easily explained by the dependence of the Northumbrian
priory of Tynemouth upon St. Albans, which supplied the mother house
with monks from the north of England.⁵ Nothing, further, could be less
likely than that the prior of a small Benedictine house in 1420 should
be preferred to an archdeaconry in a church of secular canons
during the same year. This incongruity‚ however, has been passed
unnoticed by every modern writer. In precentor Venables’ article upon
Alnwick in the Dictionary of National Biography, he proceeds from the
priory of Wymondham to the archdeaconry of Salisbury.⁶ The identity
was accepted without question by Dr. J. H. Wylie⁷ and canon Capes⁸;
1t appears in the Victoria County H istory of Norfolk with the embellish-
ment that Alnwick, as bishop of Norwich, ⁶ exemplified all the bitterness
of the monks ' against the Lollards.⁹ While this identity of a monk with
a secular arc-hdeacon is, to say the least of it, extremely doubtful, it is
certam that in 1420, as we have seen, a secular priest named William
