HousE‚1 0N THE 19TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF JANUARY‚ IN THE
YEAR oF oUR LORD 144o‚² BY THE REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST
AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM‚ ΒΥ THE GRAcE oF GoD BISHOP

FIFTH oF H1s TRANSLATION..

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge on and in the day, year and place aforesaid, for the
purpose of beginning the business of such his visitation, there appeared
before him the prior of such place and one canon only, to undergo, as
wag {pparerkhl'fht} vfflsiffition ocfl fliedaicii reveretnp. ftzffhtem and thep firtsl‘lt
an e ore a e se e wor o o was se or 1n agreemen wi
the process that was about to take place by the discreet³ master
Thomas Duffelde‚ bachelor in divinity, after this text, ‘Go and see
whether all things be well with thy brethren‚' etc. And when this
was concluded with much excellence in the Latin language, the prior
delivered to the said reverend father the mandate which had been
addressed to him by the same my lord for such his visitation, certifying
the said reverend father by word of mouth that he himself, having been
summoned by virtue of the same mandate whose purport is on such
wise, ‘William’ etc., did summon peremptorily his brethren, to wit,

³ brothers William Horbury and William Bryan, brethren together with

him, by the same authority for and to the same day and place, to under-
go such visitation and to do all else, etc. And then, after obedience had
been sworn to the aforesaid reverend father by the said prior according
to form, the same prior shewed to the said reverend father his certificates
of institution and induction in the said priory.⁴ The which having been
so done, the same reverend father committed to master John Depyng, his
chancellor, his office of examining those that should be examined and of
proceeding in the business of the said visitation, even against the absent,
according to the due legal process. And then the same commissary pro-
ceeded to the examination of the prior, who says these things which follow.
Howbeit, as regards the original documents of the foundation of the said

numerus monachorum ibidem in toto quinque monachos excedere non consuevit’, and
grant, inter alia, the advowson of the church of St. Nicholas at Arundel, ‘ad cujus rector-
iam habitatio prioris et conventus prioratus predicti post primam illius fundationem translata
fuit ; et ubi jam dictus prioratus dicitur fore situatas: (Monasticon, VI (3), p. 1378.)

Β Le. 19 Jan.‚ 1440-1.

3 Complimentary and decorative titles of this kind, of which several examples have
already occurred, begin to be common towards the middle of the fifteenth century. They
appear to be among the fruits of early Renaissance culture and to be modelled upon the use
of the imperial court of Rome, as developed in the period from Hadrian to Marcus Aurelius.
See Cambridge Medieval Hist. 1, 32, 33. They were used, however, without much system,
in contrast to the Roman gradation of epithets‚ and the same nobleman or gentleman may
appear indiscriminately as clarus, discretus, egregius, providus, strenuus vir, or with other like
e ithets.

p ⁴ The evidence for these is not forthcoming. Byrtby continued to be prior until
1449· See Visitations, 1, 162.
