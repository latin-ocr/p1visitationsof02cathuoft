Thereafter he exhibited the certificate oi the confirmation 01 1115 election
and that of his installation,² copies whereof he has not yet left with the
registrar. After this he exhibited the state of the house in which it is
to-day in a summary form, but he did not exhibit that in which he
received the house at his entry upon his office. Thereafter upon
examination he says these things which follows.

Brother Robert Ludburghe,² the prior, says that about ten years
[ago] a brother of their company, by name Richard Leke, went out in
apostasy and entered the order of friars minors : he prays, however, to
be admitted again, if leave may be favourably granted him on this
behalf. “

Α150 116 says that the canons do play of custom the game of tables.⁸

Also he says that the young [canons] are instructed in the
elementary forms of knowledge in the parish 611111611.4

Α150 116 says that the alms until of late used to be collected by a
secular and were distributed by survey of 3 canon: now the whole is
done by a canon.

Brother Richard Ingoldesby‚ the sub-prior, says that boys have too
often access to the quire in time of divine service.

Also he says that sometimes, when the son or the Officers of their
lord⁵ come to the town, the canons at their asking do eat and drink with
the same in the town of Kyme with the prior's licence. Let an injunc-
tion be made.

Also he says that, whenever their lord's son is present, Blytone goes
a-hunting, and he keeps his hounds for hunting, howbeit not at the cost
of the house. He was warned not to do the like from henceforth.

Also he prays that more kindly provision than is wont be made for
the canons who are sick in the infirmary, and this as regards fuel, more
delicate food and medicines.

Also he says that every canon who is a priest receives sixteen
shillings in the year for his raiment.

Brother Thomas Kyngtone says that the cellarer comes not, albeit
he could, to quire in time of divine service by day and by night.

Brother Thomas Marum says that the office of kitchener is in the
hands of the prior.

Also he says as above concerning them that are sick.

Brother Thomas Durham, warden oi the chapel of St. Thomas of
N 01111011116,6 says that the distributions which should be made at obits
on their lord’s behalf among the canons who are present are withheld.
The prior says that, as soon ‘as the rents assigned to this end can be
levied, such distributions are made.

disappeared, as well as 1116 6011ν61111131 buildings. From Durham’s depositions, it appears
that the 61116 of souls was at this time served by one of the canons. .

⁵ The lordship of Kyme and the patronage of the priory had descended through the
families of Kyme and Umfraville to the family of Talboys. For an account of the Lancas-
trian sir William Talboys, styled earl of Kyme, who was beheaded after the battle of Hex-
ham in 1464, see D.N. B. LV, 341. See also 11016 7 011 p. 20 above. The manor-house of the
lords of Kyme, of which the tower, an elaborate example of 1116 fortified building known in
the north of England as 3 pelertowen remains, lay to the south-east of the priory.

⁶ Northolme, which was apparently in the neighbourhood of Kyme, was, as Feltwelle’s
deposition shews, the grange, like Southrey at Bardney. Dousedalehouse at Croyland, etc„
to which the canons retired for convalescence after 11111655 01111611 periodical minutiones.
Cf. the existing remains of the grange and chapel at Wykebam, the corresponding domus
recreacionis for the monks of Spalding. Durham²s office corresponded to that of the prior
Of St. Ives at Ramsey and the prior of Oxney at Peterborough.
