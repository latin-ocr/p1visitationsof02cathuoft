church that the goods left in general by the deceased canons and vicars
should be divided in equal parts by the dean among the same canons and
vicarS, and that the rest [should be applied] to the same church and to
the use of its fabric-fund or some other use according to the pious will
of the testators ; and, as it has been disclosed to us, sir John Swalwelle,
sometime canon of the said church, left forty pounds, and sir John
Charytee, also sometime canon of the same church, fifty marks to the
provost's office, so that the ⁴same provost should make the payments
which should be made by him at the beginning of the year out of the
same sums and restore the same sums at the end of every year, and that
the said sums have now been altogether spent by you the dean and
canons or your predecessors, we enjoin and command you the dean and
canons aforesaid, since they that hinder the last wills of the deceased
incur excommunication by so doing, to cause the aforesaid sums, within
the period of two years to be counted from the time of the date of these
presents continuously, under pain of the levying of the greater excom-
munication against the persons both of you the dean and of the several
canons of the said church, to be restored to their appointed use and laid
up in the place assigned aforetime for this purpose.l

Also seeing that it stands disclosed to us that certain obits are
celebrated in the college, and that to them that celebrate them the rents
should be paid which arise from certain tenements in the town of
Leicester given for this purpose, and, albeit the obits are celebrated, yet
nothing is given to the use of those that celebrate them, we will and enjoin
that, after the lapse of a period of three years after the ordinance which
was made, as you aver, with the consent of you all touching the repair of
such tenements, the said rents be expended for the uses appointed.‘³

Also seeing that by the statutes aforesaid it is incumbent upon the
sacrist for the time being to oversee, rule and govern the choristers, and
it stands disclosed to us that the choristers of that church do in these
days wander about almost without a leader and spend their time in
gaddings-out and other breaches of discipline, making no virtuous profit
in any wise, we therefore enjoin upon you who are now the sacrist and
everyone who is to take your place in the same office, under pain of
excommunication, apart from the penalty laid by the statutes upon them
that keep them not, that you diligently oversee that the choristers, what
time they are not busied in church, do heed their learning and instruc-
tion, that so, living under the rod, they may have power to go forward
from strength to strength)

Also seeing that it has been disclosed and reported to us that Simon
Simeon did sometime found a chantry of three chaplains in the said

pounds to be received yearly at the hands of the provost of that place,
