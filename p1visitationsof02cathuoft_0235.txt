DORCHESTER ABBEY, 1445 80

that one of the canons might sing prayers every week [for the dead]‚ for
the which such canon should receive a certain allowance ; and now the
charge is performed and no payment is made for the work.

[The same says that] the prior is not wary in his corrections, for he
is quickly moved, and being moved gets beyond himself.

[Brother] . . . . Tewkesbury,l deacon, says that brother John
Clyttone, aforetime the abbot, has a chamber that has several suspect
doors, through the which almost [every night there come] to him·
suspect women from the town about two and three o’clock in the morning,
whereby he is brought into suspicion with such women; and [he is
defamed with one] of these, Margaret Tylere, and they were taken with
one another in such chamber by one of the canons of the house.

[The same] Clyftone is an evil speaker and reviler of his brethren
and is parlous with his tongue.

Also he says that several chapels and churches which are appropri-

’ ated to the monastery, six in number, are served by the canons of the

monastery, by reason whereof the number of those who serve in quire is

ε
ᾶεοῑῗλὶἶίἓάᾙε says that the common seal is kept under two locks, the keys

whereof are of one shape, and Clyftone and the prior have them in their
keeping‚ so that one of them can get at the seal without the other ;
wherefore he suspects that divers sealings are done with the same seal
without the knowledge of the convent.

Also he says that at such sealing the convent [was wont] to have
6s. 8d., and now the convent has nothing, because they know not what
things are sealed.

Also he says that sometimes the convent does not eat in the frater
for a quarter of the year, but in mixed company with secular folk, even
women, in the abbot's hall, where empty talkings and contrary to religious
discipline are held3 and at the time of refection no reading is done
an where.

y Also the bell-tower is ruinous and like to fall directly, unless it be

, repaired with all speed.

Brother Ralph Carnelle says that the present abbot has never in his
time lain of a night in the dorter according to the injunctions which
were made sometime in the monastery by my lord.

Also he says that the abbot, without asking the consent of the con—
vent and without my lord's leave, did grant a yearly pension of five marks
together with meat and drink besides to brother John Clyftone, of late
the abbot, contrary to my lord’s injunction‚³ and to William Marmyone a
pfension of four marks for the term of his life contrary to the injunctions
a oresaid.

Also he says as above concerning the doors of the said Clyftone's

⁶ chamber and concerning the entry of secular folk, even of women of ill

repnte, to the same chamber.
Also he says that the constitutions of the apostolic see and of the

 

churches, and that the custom‚ excellent in theory but unworkable in practice, had been
revived of supplying canons to serve the cures of the six churches belonging to the abbey
within the bishop’s hundred of Dorchester. Pishill and Warborough were probably served
by secular parish chaplains : Stadhampton, served by Charnelle‚ is about four miles north-
east of Dorchester, on the way to Tharne.
