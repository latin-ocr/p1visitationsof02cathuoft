LEGBOURNE PRIoRY‚ 1440 184

after this text, ‘This is the city to be visited,' etc. And when this was
done, the prioress ot the place delivered to the said commissary the
certificate of my lord's mandate which had been addressed to her for
this visitation, the purport whereof is on such wise, ‘To the reverend
father in Christ,' etc. ; but when the commission of the said sir com-
missary had been read beforehand and nothing had been said against it,
the same sir commissary took upon himself the authority committed to
him, and after [the nuns]‚ eleven in number, who had been summoned
had been called over and made their appearance, the prioress shewed
the certificate of the confirmation of her electiori made by master Thomas
Warde with the authority of the lord William, late bishop of Lincoln.1
Howbeit she exhibited nothing touching her installation, wherefore she
has Thursday after St. James' day,2 at Lincoln‚ to shew sufficient proof
of her installation. She exhibited also the ratification of William son of
Robert Lekeburne, the founder of the place, concerning the gift of the
estate and site of the priory.³ She also exhibited the state of the house
as it now stands, as they say, but not the yearly chargeS, etc. Then the
prioress on examination says these things which follow.

Dame Joan Pulvertofte,⁴ the prioreSS, says on examination that at
the time of her confirmation and installation the house was sixty-three
pounds in debt, and now s it is] only fourteen pounds. Howbeit, because
the state of the house was not fully shewn, she has the morrow at Louth
to shew more fully.

Also she says that one sir Thomas, alleged to be a chaplain, who has
held the office of parish chaplain in Legbourne t'or half a year, on admis-
sion by the same prioress and without other licence, has preached in the
conventual and also in the parish church there, etc.‚⁵ and she says that
he was reputed to be a Scotchman by nation.

Dame Joan Fraunceys says that every nun has one loaf, one half-
gallon of beer a day, one pig a year, eighteenpence for bees, every day in
Advent and Lent two herrings and a little butter in summer and some-
times two stone of cheese a year and eightpence a year for raiment and
no more.

Also she says that the vicar of Louth⁶ is the confessor for the
convent, not appointed by my lord so far as she is aware.

Also she says that several of the prioress's kindred have often access
{lo thbe priory ε she knows not, however, whether the house be bur-thened

ere y.

Darne Joan Gyney, in the household with the prioress, having her
meat only from the house and nothing at all for her raiment.

Also she says that the prioress, after she received my lord's mandate
sor the visitation, called together the chapter and said, if there were
aught in need of correction among them, they should tell it [her] ς

⁵ The parish church of Legbo'urne was distinct from the priory church, which lay to
the west of the village. Originally only a mediety belonged to the priory, the other mediety
being in the hands of the Lekeburne family (see Rotula· Hug. Wellaes [Cant. and York Soc.]
ΙΙΙ.. 69, 99). The patronage of the second mediety, however, came into the possession of the
prioress and convent about the middle of the fourteemh century, and the appropriation of
the church was completed by bishop Buekingham‚ 21 Aug.‚ 1387 (Reg. XII, fo· 342 and ἅ),
and confirmed by pope Bonilace IX, 1 Feb„ 1394-5 (Reg· XIII, f0· 54⁰¹)-
