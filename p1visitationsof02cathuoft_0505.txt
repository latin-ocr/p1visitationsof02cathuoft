Also we enj0in upon you the abbot‚ under pain of grievous con-
tempt, that according to the constitutions of the order you change your
chaplains every year, in order that, as many chaplains as you shall have,
you may have so many witnesses of your honest behaviour ; and that in
the discharge and deputation of the officers of the monastery you call
together the chapter and with the consent of the more and sounder part
of the, convent discharge those who are to be discharged and depute
those to be deputed, doing no weighty busineSS, nor leasing out {arms
also, save with the discussion and express consent of the same convent.¹

Also we enjoin upon γοα the abbot, under the penalty aforesaid, that
you be present more often than is your wont at matins, albeit you do not
perform the divine office, and at the celebration of chapters more ostem
and that you correct offenderS‚ according to the sort and degree of their
persons and transgressions and without respectos persons, in fatherly
wise and with brotherly love, and not harshly or with words of railing or
despite or accusation, but gently, so that your authority grow not to be
held cheap, and that you shew a merciful countenanee to your brethren,
and not a strangerly or disdainful, and be civil, bland and kindly to
them, as is fitting ; and that you take not on yourself in any wise to rail
against anyone or shew him over-much hardness on account of the
matters reported in this our visitation.²

Also, inasmuch as, of the ancient and praiseworthy custom of the
monastery, the sub-cellarer‚ who is also called the kitchener, should
receive all the profits that come of the church of St. Mai-tin of Leicester
to the advantage of his office, the which thing is not observed as for the
present, to the great expense of the same office, we enjoin and command
that the said cellarer or kitchener be suffered to receive such profits in
their entirety, since he is ready to surrender a reckoning concerning
them.³

Also that they who are ailing in the infirmary be served with food
agreeable to them, according to the natures of their ailmentS‚ that they

tend and do service to the same ailing persons as regards their needful
wants.

and several the persons οἱ the said convent that now are and shall be,
under the penalties written above, and none the less admonish you
a first, second and third peremptorily, under the pain of the greater
excommunication, which we intend to levy against your several persons,
if you keep not the premises, so far as they concern every one of you, or
obey not the same, that you observe them all and sundry, even as they
are written above, without breach and obey the same, as you shall wish
to escape divine and canonical vengeance, after our present letters have

may be free for anyone who wills to look upon. Given under our seal
