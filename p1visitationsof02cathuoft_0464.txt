¹ Holderness is an error for Amounderness. The church of Preston-in-Holdemess was
appropriated and annexed to the sub-deanery of York in 1228 (York lx’eg. Gray [Surtees
Soc.], pp. 26, 27). The church of Preston, Lancs.‚ was among the advowsons which the
founder had licence to alienate to the college in 1354-5 : the grant, however, seems to have
been altered, and the manor and advowson of Hannington, Wilts.‚ substituted (Assoc.
Archit. Soc. Reperts and Papers xxxn, 260, 263), Subsequently, however, on 4 July, 1440,

Henry 1V granted the advowson with lieence of appropriation (ibid., 524). The taxation of

the church‚ as stated here, is the assessinent of 1291 ; but, according to the nova laxatio
made in the northern province, after the devastation caused by the Scottish inroads temp.
Edw. 11, it was re-assessed at 35 marks (Lambeth Reg. Langham, fo. 35). The 2000 marks
and more mentioned below represents the gross income of the church for twenty-seven years,
reckoned on the 80 marks assessment: the actual total is 2160 marks (Α 1440). From the
further details given below, it would seem that the number of bedefolk in 1440 must have

been considerably less than the hundred contemplated by the founder, even allowing for
their other endowments.

Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports and Paper-s xxxn. 527. The property from which the rent was
derived lay in the parishes of St. Mary-le-Strand and St. Clement Danes.
