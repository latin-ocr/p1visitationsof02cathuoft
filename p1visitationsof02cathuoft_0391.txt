IRTHLINGBOROUGH COLLEGE, 1442 159

withholds it. He was warned under pain of suspension from his office
to be more zealous for the future in claiming and exacting such tithes
and rights.

Also he says that the secrets and debates of chapter are revealed
among the common folk of the town by almost all the canons. They
were all admonished under pain of excommunicatlon not to reveal them
henceforward.

Also he says that the canons of custom do haunt the public taverns
in the town till they are drunk, and especially Blokley ; and the dean
also. He says that he would like it to be so,1 but his fellows upbraid
him so much that he is constrained to go away from meals.

Also he says that at meal-times they have no reading, but upbraid- ·
ings and quarrellings and other things which are unfitting for priests, in
the dean's default and contrary to the statuteS. They all were enjoined
in virtue of obedience and under pain of excommunication that they
should have reading at breakfast, and at all their meals keep silence and
refrain from words of abuse. '

Also he says that the dean let the rectory house on farm to one
Richard Baker, during whose term, and in his default, there fell to ruin
a building within the rectory [premises], to the loss of twenty marks to
the college, and the dean let this Richard go free, without doing any
vrepair to the said building. He admits that the farm was granted with
the consent of all, and also that the farmer was freed, insomuch that the
indentures and bonds of the covenants [were] torn up by the consent of
all, and touching this he proffered his oath.

Also he says that sir Robert Careby was defamed with . . . . , the
wife of one . . . . of Twywe11,2 and now the matter has been more
rightly stated.

Also he says that sir John Burtone‚ who has his mother and a natural
son dwelling in the town, has often access to his mother's house at un-
befitting times, and the son is too kindly with the said John in quire and
at the altar, to the dishonouring of God and the scandal of the college.
He denies the article to the letter: howbeit he was warned that he
should not suffer him henceforward in such a place.

[Also he says that William] Brauncepathe gave to the fabric
of the new chancel twenty marks,³ John Brauncepathe six marks, and one
. . . . [of] London forty shillings, and Ellen Lord4 a certain some-
thing, whereof they know not ; all which the dean did receive, and it is
not known how [the money is laid out], since he has rendered no account

of having their meals in the common hall, and answered that, as sor himself, he was willing
to eat in hall, but the altitude of the fellows towards him drove him to the tavern.
K 2 Twywell is some five miles north of Irthlingborough‚ between Thrapston and

³ Fgr Brauncepathe see note 9 on p. 158 above. The fabric is no doubt the ‘works' or
fabric fund devoted to offerings for this special purpose. See Visitations 1x 39, note 1 ; 142,
note 3. Neitherthe ‘ new chancel’ nor any chapel which could bear the name were built.
It was doubtless intended to extend or rebuild the chancel of the parish church on a scale
worthy of a collegiate establishment, as at Tattershall.

⁴ Ellen Lord was possibly a relation of Henry Lord, who was one of the first two
(ignens and fseems to have been sub-dean before 11 June, 1410, when his death is noted

eg. xm, o. 243d.)
