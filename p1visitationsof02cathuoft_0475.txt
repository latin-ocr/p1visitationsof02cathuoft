Also we enjoin and ordain and strictly command, under the penalties
written above and beneath‚ that no canon, vicar or minister of the same
church roam outside the quire in the nave of the church or elsewhere in
time of divine service, in his quire-habit or secular dreSS, or talk with
secular folk, unless he be of such a sort that he must do business out of
quire at such times by reason of his office, or he be in his seynies ; and
that no one in quire or at the altars in time of divine service do take on
himself to wear shoes shod with wood or iron, since such, as they walk
about, make a noise which is very troublesome to them that are singing.¹

Also in pursuance of the statutes aforesaid we enjoin upon you all
and several that are in priest's orders, under the penalty abovesaid„that
you who are resident in the church or within the college do altogether
wear long cassocks and cloaks and boots of black colour only, according
to the intention of the statute published touching this.2

Also we enjoin upon you the dean, the canons, vicars and other
chaplains whomsoever, under the penalties abovesaid, that you receive
no women whatever within your lodgings by night, nor suffer them to
have often access thereto by day or by night, by whom or whose access
scandal may in any sort be caused to the college or the persons thereos.⁸

Also, since the offices of the provost and the lieutenant of the dean
in his absence are not in such wise compatible, so that they may be held
at the same time and for the nonce by one and the same person, we
enJ'oin upon you the dean and every one that shall succeed you, in virtue
of holy obedience and under pain of grievous contempt, that you in no
wise appoint him that has erewhile been put into the office of the provost-
ship to be your' lieutenant for the time of your absence, or on the other
hand suffer your lieutenant hereafter to be appointed to the other office.⁴

Also we enjoin upon you who are now the provost and upon every-
one that shall succeed you in such office, under the penalty aforesaid,
that, before γοα go out of the college to pursue its business affairs, γοα
give an exact account to the dean or, in his absence, to the sacrist of
the church aforesaid, of the reason and duration of your absence on such
business and of its nature, as the statute published touching this requires 3
and that twice in every year, to wit in the quinzaine of Easter and the
quinzaine of Michaelmas, you render altogether and at any rate a faithful
reckoning of your administration fulfilled by you in respect of the
spiritual and temporal goods of the same church, in presence of the dean
or his lieutenant and three other canons to be chosen by the chapter to
this end, even as the aforesaid statutes require.⁵

Also we enjoin upon you the dean and all the canons that now are
and shall be, under the penalties written above and beneath, that you
admit no persons as boarders to lodge with you within the college, except
they be grave persons of honest conversation and seemly report, to the
which persons we forbid that there be made or had at all recourse of

women within the college aforesaid.⁶
