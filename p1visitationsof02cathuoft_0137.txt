monastery of Bardney, of the order of St. Benet, of our diocese, together

convent of the said monastery, did seal or cause to be sealed with the
common seal of the said monastery secretly, even by night, without the will,
knowledge or consent of the said convent or at any rate of the more and
sounder part thereos, certain empty sheets, otherwise called blank parch-
ments, and did command, or at any rate did hold and do hold ratified and
likewise accepted such sealing done in your name and at your command,
wherefrom we sear will corne about the final undoing and incurable harm,
nay, indeed, the ultimate abandonment of the same monastery, and desir-
