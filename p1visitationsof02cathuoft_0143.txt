THE VISITATION OF THE PRIORY OF BICESTER, OF THE ORDER OF
ST. AUSTIN, OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN‚ PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HousE THERE ON THE 28TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF
MAY, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1445, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM ALNEWYKE,
ΒΥ THE GRACE OF GOD BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE 19TH YEAR
OF H1s CONSECRATION AND THE NINTHssF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, first and before [all else] the word Of God was
set forth in the presence Of the said reverend father in the parish church
of Bicester,² there being present in that place the prior and convent of
the said priory and a throng of clergy and people gathered together
therein, by the distinguished master John Beverley, professor of holy
writ,³ after this text, ‘Tarry ye in the city until ye be endued with
power from on high ⁷, etc. And when this had come to a praise-
worthy end in the vulgar tongue, the same reverend father, on and in the
same day and year and chapter—house, sat in his capacity of judge in the
beginning of such his visitation, and then there appeared before him
the prior and convent of the same place, ready, as was apparent, to
undergo such visitation. And in the sequel the said prior handed to the
said reverend father the certificate Of my lord's mandate, which had
been addressed to him for such visitation‚ fully composed, the purport
whereof is on such wise, ‘TO the reverend father in Christ’, etc. The
which having been read through in the general hearing at the command
Of the said reverend father, the same prior shewed the said reverend
father his certificates Of confirmation and installation, such as they were.
He shewed also the state Of the house; and then he formally sware
obedience and fealty. And thereafter, being examined, he says the things

which follow.

Brother John Wantyng,⁴ the prior, [says] that the house can spend
‚g 140 yearly 3 and there are two canons not yet professed.

 

 

² The visitation probably took place at the same time as that of the clergy and people
of the rural deanery of Bicester. The bishop may have left this to commissaries in the

derived from Wantyngges, i.e. Wantage, Berks. The sub—prior, William Chestertone and
Robert Lawntone (Launton), all three evidently belonged to the immediate neighbourhood

of the priory.
