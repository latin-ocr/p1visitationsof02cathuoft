And then my lord adjourned such his visitation until the day which
was then the morrow, there being present the dean of the place, master
J. Depyng and Ι Colstone, and several others of the chapter.

On the said first day of December in the said chapter-house there
appeared in person before my lord the aforesaid master John Dey, canon,
and, when he was charged with the guilt of sodomy with these with
whom he is reported, denies all such guilt, declaring that, if these two
youths will bear this witness against him, he will make renunciation of
all his benefices in the world.1 Notwithstanding, because this inquiry is
preparatory and general, my lord appointed to the same Dey the day
which was then the morrow in the same chapter-house before my lord,
to see particular inquiry made touching the premises and to do what
else, etc.. there being present the dean'of the place, Halywelle, Fysshe-
wyk, Depyng and I Colstone.

access almost every day to his house which he has as canon. He
appeared and denies his guilt and the article in every part thereos 3
wherefore my lord bade him clear himself there and then of all3 with
three of his brethren. Wherefore he cleared himself with Bedale,
Welles and Gaddesby, and was warned, under pain of excommunication
and six shillings and eightpence to the fabric fund of the church, to have
no familiar intercourse with these [women], etc. (Matfene.)

The same is defamed with Maud Bartone of the parish of St.
Leonard of Leicester, who has confessed such guilt. The same is
defamed with Joan Jaksone‚ of whom he had carnal knowledge within
the lodging which he has as canon. He appeared and denies the first
article, averring that he had cleared himself touching this 3 and he has
the morrow in the morning to exhibit his certificate of such purgation.
As concerns the second, he denies his guilt and knowledge of the person
and her name. <T he same.)
