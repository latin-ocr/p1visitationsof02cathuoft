Also she says that cloister is not kept, nor even so has it been the

custom from of old.
Also she says that the cellaress and sub-cellaress do, as bursars1‚

receive and lay out all the revenues of the house.
Dame Agnes Roteby, the sub-prioreSS, says that the prioress does

5. not lszhogfs herself impartial to all, but is too harsh to some and to some is
’ ἶ too in .

Also she says that the prioress by reason of old age and incapacity

, - has renounced for herself all the governance of matters temporal, nor does
she take part in divine service, so that she is of no use ; but if she makes

any correctionS, she makes them with words of chiding and abuse.
Also she says that under this prioress religious discipline almost

altogether is at an end.

Also she says that there are certain nuns whom the prioress calls
her disciples, that keep always close to the prioreSS, and to these and the

'prioress secular folk have often access, with whom these pupils hold

, . unseemly conversations.

Also she says that the prioress makes no reckoning yearly before
her sisters in common.

Also she says that the jewels of the house are put in pawn without
the knowledge of the convent, but she knows not to whom or wherefore,
insomuch that they have not one goblet wherein they can drink.

The prioress makes the secrets of their religious life common among
the secular folk that sit at table with her to the great scandal thereos.

Also she says that Margaret Belers holds all their temporal affairs in
her own hands without consultation with her fellow treasurer or with
any one of the convent.

Α13ο she says that according to the rule they ought to be assured of
the state of the house and of the accounts in common four times in the
year, and this is no longer done ε therefore they are in ignorance of its
state.

Also she says that from the time of the last visitation there has been
no love among them, for from that time ever since [the prioress] has
reviled the nuns for the matters disclosed by them in the same visitation.

Also she says that the cellaress comes not to quire either by day or
by night, and not even on Sundays or feast-days.

Also she says that that cellaress visits by herself over early of a
morning the offices and the other outbuildings wherein men are occupied.

Also the prioress has a boarder who came to the place within [the
last] three days, and she is the daughter of one Vilers²

Also she says that the chaplain and Bellers did go out to their
autumn tasks to mow hay and to harvest, insomuch that she rode back at
evening behind him on the same horse, and since then she has been and
is too free in converse with him.

Also she says that the said chaplain, by name Henry, does not say

⁸ Sic: for eas.
⁴ Sc. priorissa.
