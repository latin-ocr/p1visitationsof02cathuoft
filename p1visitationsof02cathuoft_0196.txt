(Contra priorem.) Item dicit quod quam omni die dominica seu
festino laici seculares, mares et femine, sedent in refectorio et infirmaria
vacantes comesacionesl et potacionibus ad magnum domus dispendium
et grandes expensas. . . .

(Contra priorem.) Frater Willelmus Watforde, supprior, dicit quod
prior non est circumspectus in temporalibus: ideo omnia tendunt ad
non esse, licet aliqualem habeat experienciam in artificio cementario et
carpentario.

(Contra priorem.) Item dicit‚² videlicet tempore vltime vacacionis,
Henricus Brewies, Fysshere, Thomas Hald'‚ clericus, Newenham, iam
auditor cum comite Huntingdonie‚ Nicholaus Weste de Dauentre et alii
plures de Dauentre, amici prioris moderni, obligarunt se Willelmo Tres-
ham et Ricardo Knyghtley in notabilibus pecuniarum summis³ ad soluen-
dum debita domus, que protunc ere alieno multipliciter grauabatur, eo
pacto quod iam prior modernUS, qui tunc fuit monachus monasterii de
Burgo sancti Petri, eligeretur in priorem, cuius prouisionem et eleccionem
Thomas N ewenham solicitabat ε et dicta obligacio fuit liberata con-
uentui per ipsos obligatos ante ipsam eleccionem de ipso nunc priore
celebratam. Iuratus de veritate dicenda, negat noticiam ante eleccionem:
fatetur tamen se audisse talia post confirmacionem, et credit ea vera ; et
hoc commonachi sui sibi retulerunt. Fatetur eciam liberacionem factam
per consensum suum de obligacione illa hiis qui obligabantur.

² The buildings of the priory have disappeared, and the position of the conduit cannot
therefore be stated. lt may have been east of the cloister‚ near the infirmary buildings, as
at Christchurch‚ Canterbury. The great cistern at F ountains appears to have been close
to the infirmary.

2 The persons involved in each detectum are noted in the margin, as in several other
cases. This and the next detectum, as in other similar cases, were obviously obtained by
questioning the prior, and are confessions as distinct from his complaints.

³ The view οἱ the remains of the priory in Bridges’ Hist. Northants, ι, 48, shews that
the cloister was on the north of the church, which, like the churches at Canons Ashby and
Brackley hospital, had a north-west tower. This was joined by the western range of
cloister buildings, on the first fioor οἱ which were the prior’s lodging and guest-hall, entered
by a stair set against the west wall of the range. The ground-floor was apparently occupied
by cellars, with a passage into the cloister near the middle of the range, south of the prior's
stair. The arrangement closely resembles that at the Premonstratentian abbey οἱ Torre,
Devon. The church had a western doorway, covered by a porch, apparently of timber, and
a broad south aisle‚ which, as at Blyth, Nous, may have been used as the parish church.
The only means of access to the church appears to have been through the outer court, and
the parishioners obviously had been allowed to use the cloister doorways instead of the
western entrance. The present church of Daventry is a classical building of 1752, and the
last remains of the priory buildings disappeared in 1824.

⁴ The word secularis of course covers priests as well as laity‚ which accounts for the
qualification made here.
