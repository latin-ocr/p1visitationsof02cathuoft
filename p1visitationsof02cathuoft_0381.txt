HUNTINGDON PRIORY, 1439 154

the prior says, with the consent of the convent. Okle and Rysshetone
deny that they consented of their free will.

As for his apostasy by night in a secular garb and the laying of
hands with violence upon divers men, where and when his arm was
broken in the strugg1e1‚ about the feast of St. Bartholomew, in the year
of our Lord 1436, he confesses that he went out at such a time by night,
dressed in his riding cloak and a secular hood of a black hue : he con-
fesses also the struggle and [the use of] violence on both sides.

- As for the celebration of masses during such apostasy with no
previous absolution, he confesses that he has celebrated mass a hundred
times since such struggle without obtaining any absolution, for he says
that he did not incur irregularity for that reason.5⁴

As for this, that Joan Dey did lie in the buttery within the priory,
hard by the prior’s lodging‚⁸ every night one autumn season, he denies
the article : howbeit he confesses that, as he heard afterwards, she lay
there with her husband, but not with his will or knowledge.

As for this, that the prior said to certain of his canons that, if he
should have but three pence, John Clerk and his wife and daughters
should have one of them, he denies the article to the letter.

As for this, that the prior, neglecting the canonical hours, leaves out
the words of consecration when he celebrates mass, and yet the whole
service which he says in a year is not equal in amount to the office of a
single month, he denies the article to the letter.

- As for this, that the prior comes hardly four times in a year to
matins and has made his confession scarcely twice in the half year, he
denies the article, for he makes mention of the confessors to whom he
has confessed.

As for this, that the house suffers damage to the amount of two
hundred marks by means of the prior's mother and the recourse to her
of the women who are defamed, he denies the article.

As for this, that the table-linei] and beds of the priory are lent by
the prior to his sister and other kinsfolk and are not given back, he
answers as above concerning the table-limen. The beds are out of the
house ε the prior does not say where they are.

As for the recourse of the prior to the house of John Clerk, even by
night, and his eatings and drinkings therein contrary to the injunction of
William Gray . . . . , and when he laid violent hands upon one John
Bayly about the feast of St. Andrew, in the year of our Lord 143o‚⁴ and
the same prior still withholds a rent from the said John, he confesses
that he laid violent hands upon the said John Bayly. The prior denies
that this Bayly [has had] no money with his consent.

As' for this, that the prior has put the house in debt to the amount
of very heavy sums during his presidency, over and above the abovesaid.⁵

As for the prior's going forth by night in his surplice to the house
of John Plummer, otherwise Clerk or Derham, and his drinking therein,

 

 

 

that the struggle on his part was purely one of sels-defence. To admit the contrary of
either would have been to confess that his subsequent action was irregular.

³ The neighbourhood of the prior’s lodging to the buttery shews that, as in many other
canons' houses, it was on the west side of the cloister, adjoining the range of buildings con-
taining the frater, near the west end of which was the buttery.

⁴ If this date is right, it was some time before Gray's visitation. The act of violence
previously mentioned was in August, 1436.

⁵ l.e. the various losses incurred by the prior in wasting the money, plate‚ etc., os the
house, which have been previously mentioned.
