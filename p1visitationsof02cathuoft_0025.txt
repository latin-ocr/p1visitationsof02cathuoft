INTRODUCTION xvii

Alnwick, whom there is every reason for identifying with the future
archdeacon and bishop, was rector of a church in the archdeaconry of
Richmond. And, although the monk disappears from Wymondham in
1420, and the secular becomes archdeacon of Salisbury at the end of the
same year, apparently retaining his church of Goldsborough till some-
what later, this is merely a coincidence which proves nothing. When
on 22 Sept, 1435, we find bishop Gray instituting a monk named William
Alnwick to the priory of Belvoir, another cell of St. Albans,¹ it is probable
that here we meet again the monk of St. Albans who had been preferred
t0 the cell of Wymondham in 1420 ; and it can hardly be doubted that
this monk in the meantime, and certainly from 1428 to 1434, had held
the monastic office of archdeacon of St. Albans.² In 1435 Alnwick had
been bishop of Norwich for nine years, so that it is impossible to add
the archdeaconry of St. Albans or the priory of Belvoir to the list of his
beneficeS.

In 1408 William Alnwick, a canon of the Premonstratensian abbey
of Alnwick who held, according to the privilege accorded to Premon-
stratensian houses, the vicarage of the appropriated church of Chatton,
was pardoned for treasonable correspondence with the earl of North-
umberland, after the overthrow of Northumberland's rebellion at Bram-
ham moor. Mr. Cadwallader Bates suggested that this might be the
future bishop.⁸ If so, in 1408 he must have been a premonstratensia-n
canon and in priest’s orders. But, three years later, when we have our
first authentic notice of the future bishop’s existence, he was a secular
clerk, and, from the terms of his appointment to the office of papal
notary, in minor orders. This of itself makes the identification unlikely.

⁷* More than this, the name of William Alnwick was probably often to be

found among the canons of Alnwick abbey ; and, as a matter of fact, in
May, 1424, a canon of the house named William Alnewyck had a papal
indult to study at a university for seven years.⁴ Whether this was the
William who was vicar of Chatton in 1408 or another canon of the same
name is immaterial : it certainly was not the contemporary secular arch-
deacon of Salisbury, who had gone through his studies at Cambridge
and received his doctor's degree several years before 1424. Mr. Bates'
suggestion therefore depends upon a casual identity of name. Dr. Wylie
also noticed the canon of Alnwick, and, with a bold ssight of imagina-
tion, combined him with the monk of St. Albans and the future bishop.5
Probability and historic fact are alike against the identification of the
monk with the secular. It would be highly unsafe to identify either the
secular or the monk with the canon regular, but to identify the three is
inadmissible.

A more specious theory is the statement, adopted in the Dictionary
of National Biography, that William Alnewyk, appointed by Henry v in
March,1414- 5, as confessor to the nuns of Syon, was the same person as our
bishop. It seems likely at first sight that the man who afterwards became
confessor to Henry vl should have served in this capacity. The terms
