the certificate of my lord's mandate which had been addressed to him
for the business of such visitation,co1nposed after this form, ‘To the
reverend ', etc. The which having been read through, the abbot shewed

shillings.

house, while he was engaged in London on the business of the house,
departed there in apostasy, and, as he believes and is informed, is dwell-
ing 'near Warwick and was sometime secondary to the dean of the
college of Warwick‚⁵ [and] having his conversation in those parts in the
secular habit, was recognised by divers folk of Bourne as they went on
pilgrimage to Hayles⁶ ; and he says that he has been but lately with
John Warnere at Stamford.

Also he says that the house is {75 and somewhat more in debt‚
even as is contained in his account ; but he does not exhibit the names
of the creditors or [the particulars] of the debts also which are due to

beautiful site beneat'n the western slopes of the Cotswolds by Richard, earl of Cornwall,
and colonised from Beaulieu in Hampshire in 1246. Matthew Paris records the dedication
of the church on 9 Nov.‚ 1251, when thirteen bishops took part in the ceremony, Robert
Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, officiating at the high altar, although the abbey was not in
his diocese. It became a famous place of pilgrimage‚ owing to the possession of a phial of
the Precious Blood, an honour which it shared with the house of Bonshommes at Ashridge‚
Bucks‚ founded by Edmund‚ earl of Cornwall. in 1283. To provide a fitting shrine for this
relic, the eastern arm of the abbey church was lengthened with an apse and outer ring of
chapels in 1277. See Mr. Harold Brakspear’s article in Archaeol. Journal, LV111 (also in
Eristol and Glouc. Archoeol. Soc. Trans„ XXIV), and Mr. St. Clair Baddeley’s A Cotteswold

excavated and planned. The direct route from Bourne to Hayles would lie through Stam-
ford, Market Harborough, Rugby, Warwick and Stratford-on-Avon‚ and so along the foot
of the Cotswolds by Broadway.
