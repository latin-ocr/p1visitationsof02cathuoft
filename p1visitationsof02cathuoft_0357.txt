(The abbot: he confesses.) Also he says that the abbot does not
attend [to religion], nor is there a prior there or sub-prior or other
deputy whom the others should obey as regards religion ; and therefore
each one goes his own way at his heart's desire.

(He confesses.) Also he says that these three years ten titles of
their rule have not been read in chapter, because chapters are not held

[and] scarcely [have they been] once inten years, in the abbot's default.

Brother william Anderby says that the abbot celebrates mass hardly
once a fortnight, and, as regards the observance of religious discipline
and divine service he agrees in all things with Fresshney ; nor does [the
abbot] say matins or the hours in quire or in church, but hardly at all
while he roams abroad¹ ; and he hears mass scarcely every day.

AIso, albeit he who in one week is hebdomadary2 is bound during
the next week to celebrate the requiem mass and say placebo with dirige
and the commendation⁸ daily, this deponent says that John Gedeney does
not perform this charge in his course ; for in such course he celebrates
hardly once or twice in his week. He confesses it. Wherefore it was
enJ'oined upon him to perform this charge henceforward‚ unless there
exist a lawful reason approved by the abbot, and to say placebo and
dirige five times. ’

Also he says that the obits for the founder and other benefactors
are not kept in the abbot's default. He denies it : he confesses that the
founder's obit had been left off for two years. He sware therefore that
it shall be observed henceforth‚ and for this neglect to say placebo and
dirige for the founder seven times, and for the abbots⁴ five times more
than the due number on this side the Assumption.

Also he says as above concerning the absence of John Gedeney from
matins in Lent, and he comes to matins hardly twice in the week 3 and,
if any one speaks hereof to the abbot, the abbot passes it by in silence
as regards Gedeney, but scolds them that complain. Gedeney denies it
and has a term before my lord’s departure to clear himself with two
canons⁵ his brethren.

Also he says as above concerning the account that is not rendered
by the abbot, and he says that the abbot, without the advice and
knowledge of the convent, leased the manor of Thrunscoe,⁶ which was
wont to be let for five marks at the time of his entrance into religion, and
within these two years was let to Peter Thorte, the abbot’s kinsman, for
36s. 8d. ; and now he has leased it at farm to John Dene for twenty-two
years for tWenty shillings a year, of the which farm he received ten
pounds in ready money, but what has been done with the money
received he cannot depose; and now this present farmer has let the

Yorkshite.
