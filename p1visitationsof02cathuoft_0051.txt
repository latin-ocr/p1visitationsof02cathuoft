The last dated documents 01 Alnwick's episcopate are from London

on 2 and 3 December, 1449. His death took place upon the 5th of that -

ῐῐιοῃ’1111111116311011311111 dry and tedious as is this record of dates, and

doubtful as are several of the points which it raises, it presents a detailed
view of the activities 01 3 bishop who not merely had charge 01 311
enormous diocese, but was intimately connected with public affairs
as well. While he himself spent 3 considerable portion of each year 31
1113 various manors and so was continually travelling up and down
the diocese, it is evident, from the liberal confusion of dates which has
been notieed‚ that at Nettleham‚ Lincoln‚ Buckden‚ Sleaford, Liddington,
and the Old Temple, his registrars and clerks were constantly busy with
an official correspondence, carried on in his name, most 01 which, except
the fragments selected for inclusion in the register at Lincoln‚ has
necessarily perished. Allowing that the bishop exercised no close
personal supervision over most 01 1116 documents issued in his name,
and that those which remain to us testify to the energy of his secretaries
rather than 10 1113 own, yet it can hardly be doubted that his frequent
presence in his unwieldy diocese showed a genuine devotion to its
interests and a desire 10 keep in close touch with them. He was never
far from it: Cambridge and London were 31 110 long distance from
its frontiers3 Reading and Windsor were separated from it only by the
Thames; Winchester was farther off, but no very long way. It is
dangerous. however, to form positive conclusions with regard to the
character of a man who is known to us mainly through the medium
01 1113 official documents. Something, as has been shown already, can be
gathered from scattered sources as to Alnwick’s personal interests ; but,
so far as the official records of his· acts go, we learn little. The age in
which he lived was singularly bound by precedent and custom 3 and
the time-honoured phraseology which had a formula for every occasion
is an 6116011131 barrier to any real knowledge of the individual man. The
63111631 piety which distinguishes the preambles 01 injunctions was the
common property of every bishop’s chancery in England ε 311011 forms as

specially fitted, and tell us no more 01 111611 nominal author than they do

the occasion. Nor, on the other hand, if we seem to come closer
to Alnwick in the acts 01 1113 1113113110113, 316 11116 really much nearer than
before. The work was routine-work ε 113 severity and its humanity were
dictated by precedent. In reading the numerous processes recorded in
