LEICESTER, NEW coLLEGE, 1440 198

noluit indicare sed dixit omnino quod viles et fede ac pessime erant et
propter earum feditatem abhorruit eas enarrare. Preterea dicit iste iuratus
quod Henricusl Craven, chorista, simili modo similia et eadem quasi
retulit isti iurato, sed2 que aut qualia noluit ille Henricus indicare isti
iurato, vt dicit iste iuratus.

Sir William Bedale.⁸

(Injunction.) Sir Roger Clystone, vicar in the quire of the collegiate
church of Leicester, says that the payments of the yearly obits, from
which they ought to receive certain sums of money, are withdrawn from
the same vicars by the provost . . . .

(Injunction.) Also he says that whereas of custom and by the
sworn statutes of the said college four at least of the canons in the same
place ought to be present at matins when they are celebrated by night,
hardly two are present or seem to be present.

Sir Richard Kemshale, vicar, etc., as regards the payment of the
obits and the rising of the canons to matinS, agrees with him who was
examined last above.

Sir Richard Greve, vicar, etc., says that one sir John Bramburghe,
canon of the said college, in time of divine service in quire, when it is
celebrated thei-ein, takes part in their prayers and collects in so loud a
voice that he causes no little annoyance to the other ministers of the
quire in the same place, disturbing and grievously hindering them, as is
aforeset.

The same says that master John Dey, canon, etc., is a haunter of the
public taverns in the town of Leicester, to the grievous scandal of the
said college and his brethren thereos.

(Injunction.) Also he says that one Simon Symeon, now deceased,
gave and granted to the canons and vicars of the said college, to the
canons to wit seven pounds and to the vicars thirteen pounds yearly, to
be paid at the feasts of the Annunciation and of St. Michael the arch-
angel. Howbeit the said thirteen pounds are not paid to the said vicars
in respect of the terms of the Annunciation and Michaelmas last past,
with the exception of four shillings to each vicar.

Sir Robert Matiene, canon of the collegiate church, says that he
knows nothing as to what has been corrected by the dean, etc.

[Sir John Shyuyngham.]

Sir John Bramburghe, canon, etc.‚ says that master John Dey is a
common haunter of tavernS, etc., as above.

The same master John leaves his dwelling-house within the close of
Leicester and his rectory-house of Wigston⁴ unrepaired and suffers them
almost to fall to the ground by his carelessness and neglect.

The same [says] that sir Robert Matiene, master of the hospital in

Leicester,⁵ wears a black habit, to wit a cloak with a sign, a crescent to
wit, on the right side.

 

⁸ These additional detecta are written on a loose sheet of paper and are incomplete. The
depositions of only eight of the thirteen canons and prebendaries, including the dean, are
given in the main body of the visitation : among them was Bedale. The evidence of three
more appears on this sheet. Dey was obviously excluded from giving evidence, and
Shiryngham gave none, although the minutes of the visitation show that he was present.

The evidence of several os the vicars, of the chauny-priests, and the lay members of the
foundation, is wanting.

⁴ See note 2 on p. 188 above.
⁵ Le. St. Leonard's hospital ε see note 5 on p. 190 above.
