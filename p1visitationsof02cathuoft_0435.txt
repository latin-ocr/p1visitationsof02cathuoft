LAUND PRIORY, 1440 181

ot St. Austin, of our diocese, who now are and shall be, health, grace and
blessing. In our sometime visitation of you and the said your priory, as
was incumbent upon us, [and] when we made anxious inquiry concerning

the state thereos both within and without, we found a very few, but .

needful matters worthy of reform which were revealed and 1Nep01ted to
us in such our visitation. We therefore despatch to you our lawful and
canonical injunctions and commands which are written beneath, to be
observed without breach by you and your successors that shall be.

In the first place, we enjoin upon you and command that you do
altogether keep silence in and at the due and requisite places and hours
according to the regular institutes of your order, or cause it to be kept
by those of your house that are professed ; and whosoever shall . . . . or
transgress herein, for the first time let him fast the next [Wednes]day on
bread and beer, for the second time the next Wednesday and Friday
on bread and water, and for the third time on all Wednesdays and
Fridays for [the half year next] following on bread and water ; and so,
as the fault grows, let the penalty also of the transgressor herein be
duly increased at the discretion of the president [of your order].l

Also we enjoin upon you who now are and him who shall be the
prior and on the rest of the presidents of the order in that place that you
do keep diligent watch that fitting service be done to the old and the

weaknesses, that they may be more speedily revived thereby ; and that
you cause service to be done in any wise to such old and ailing foll< in

house.²

Also we enjoin and command that those alms which, of the praise-
worthy custom of the house, are distributed on behali of deceased canons
in the year next after their death, be distributed among the poor that are
most in need, as them that are crazy and lie in their beds by reason of
the powerlessness of their bodies, if so be' that such may be found in
the neighbourhood, and not among others by favour3 provided that such
as have faithfully spent their days in the service of the house, and are
now come to so great weakness that they cannot seek their living with
their own hands, be preferred before others in such distributionf’

Also we command, strictly enjOining upon you all and several who
now are and shall be, that no one of you from henceforth shall take
upon him to celebrate annals or trentals without licence of your ordinary
specially asked and had, and your patron's consent agreeing hereunto.⁴

Also that from henceforth no women that dwell anigh you shall
come within the screens between the nave and the upper part or quire
of the church to hear masses, but that provision be so made that they
may hear such masses in the nave aforesaid.⁵
