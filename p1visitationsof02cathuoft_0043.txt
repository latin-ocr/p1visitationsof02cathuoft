INTRODUCTION xxxv

Lincoln archdeaconry, beginning in the south-west of the county. His
course was as follows :

16 June, Bourne abbey 3 17, Βο111·110 ; 18, 19, Croyland abbey3 21,
Shene (probably an error)1; 27, Spilsby5 2 July, Alford; 4, Louth;
6, Humberstone abbey ; 7, 8, Wellow abbey ; 9, 10, Nuncoton priory ;
11, Thornton abbey3 14, Elsham priory ; 19, Benniworth3 21, T etford ς
22, Ηο111035110; 23, Stixwould priory ; 25, Stainfield priory, Nettleham ;
28, Nettleham, Lineoln; 30, Sleaford. To the personal visitations
of this tour should be added that of Legbourne priory (Sunday, 3 J uly),
which was performed by commission. The archdeaconry, however,
was not yet wholly covered. Throughout August Alnwick was mainly
at Sleaford, but he visited Boston 011 5 August, probably because he had
omitted the deanery of Holland in his progress of 19-21 June.'² On 29
August he was at Biggleswade and two days later in London, but
he was again at Sleaford from 12 to 22 September, at Nettleham on the
28th and 29th, and at Tattershall on the 3oth. Lineoln archdeaconry
was finished in October, when the dates fall thus: 3, visitation of
the cathedral3 ; 5, Nettleham; 6, Bardney abbey, Nettleham (also
Sleaford, which must be wrong) ; 7, visitation of the cathedral continued ;
9, Νο1110113111 ; 12, Nocton park priory 3 13, Blankney ; 14, Kyme priory ;
16, Sleaford 3 21, the Stamford monasteries.⁴

From Stamford Alnwick went to Liddington (24 October)⁵ and
Buckden (30, 31 October). Sleaford, 6 November, may fairly be
dismissed ,· but from 8-11 November the bishop was once more at
Liddington, which evidently formed the starting-point 101 3 visitation

¹ . 01 1110 neighbouring archdeaconry 01 Leicester. This was performed in

two sections, between which Christmas intervened, thus :
November, 1440. 21, Laund priory ; 22, Owston abbey 3 24,
Bottesford·by-Belvoir; 26, 27, Kirby Bellars priory ; 28, Asfordby.
December, 1440. 1-5, Leicester. This completed the visitation of
three deaneries, viz. Goscote, Framland and the Christianity of Leicester-

¹ This is impossible to explain. The only alternative is to suppose that there is a
mistake in the year and date, or that some place in Lincolnshhe, between Croyland and
ξ ἰὶείδγᾶἰε meant. None, however, seems likely, and the word may be simply an error for

ea or .

2 Croyland abbey was in the deanery oi Holland, but Boston was the natural centre sor
the visitation of the deanery, as distinct from the monasteries within its borders. As
regards the deanerieS, the June and July visitations sugggest that Aveland deanery was
visited at Bourne, Bolingbroke at Spilsby, Calcewaith at Alford, Louthesk and Ludborough
at Louth‚ Grimsby at Grimsby, Yarborough between 19 and 21 July, probably at Barton-
on-Humber or Brigg, Wraggoe at Benniworth, Hill at Tetford, Horncastle at Horncastle,
and Gartree between 23 and 25-July. There is room between 27 June and 2 July for a
visitation of Candleshoe deanery. probably at Wainfleet or Burgh, and between 14 and 19
July for Walshcroft deanery, probably at Market Rasen. This would cover the whole of
the archdeaconry between the Witham and the Humber.

³ Bradshaw and Wordsworth, op. cit. 111. 443-50.

⁴ This second part of the visita-„ion may have opened with the visitation of t'ne deanery
of the Christianity of Lineoln at Lineoln. Blankney on 13 Oct. indicates a visitation οἱ
Longoboby deanery, which was probably followed 'ny one of Lafford deanery at Sleasord.
The deaneries of Grantham and Beltisloe may have been visited between the 16th and 21st,

- and there is room sor Ness and stamford deaneries about the 21st. The two deaneries οἱ

Graffoe and Loveden are unaccounteci for; but one could 'nave been visited easily from
Lineoln between the 9th and 12111, while the natural date for Loveden deanery would fall
about 17 Oct., on the way from Sleaforci to Grant'nam.

⁵ It was on this date that he issued the decree erecting the church of Tattershall into a
college. 01 which he was one of the joint founders (Cal. Papal Letters lx, 159·63).
