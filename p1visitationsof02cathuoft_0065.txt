retain the fruits of another or more in connexion with which no serious
guilt could be found. Gascoigne‚ an unsparing and by no means unpre-
judiced critic of bishops,l mentions a case in which ‘of late the love of
sin is fostered by one bishop, in that the parishioners of a certain church
have said, ‘⁴ Now we believe that adultery and fornication is no sin ; for,
if it were sin, our bishop would have deprived our rector of his cure,
because our bishop knows that our rector has been publicly taken in
adultery with one of his own parishioners, the wife of another man, and
yet the bishop has not expelled him from the cure.''' He goes on to
blame his own university for admitting the same man to the degree of
doctor of canon law, and concludes that ‘many men are not afraid to
sin, because sin is not punished in other men, and, because they are not
punished, they believe that that which is sin is not sin.' ² This, no
doubt, was the effect upon the parishioners with whom Gascoigne
sympathised ; but the bishops also had their own point of view which is
less easily grasped by the irresponsible critic. The existing fragment of
Alnwick’s consistory court-book contains several instances against which
the same cry could be raised. In 1448, William Wither, rector of
Belton, near Grantham‚ brought an action for assault in the church
porch and brawling in church against a man and his wife, who proffered
a counter-charge of immorali-ty against the rector. The root of the
matter⁴ was probably a refusal to pay tithe ε the woman. at any rate, had
flung a chicken, which she owed as tithe, at the rector’s head while he
was saying mass; and, if this was merely a protest against his moral
conduct. it must be owned that it was made with a suspicions want of
temperance. Both sides found compurgatorS‚ the rector clearing himself
with three neighbouring rectors and sixlaymen, and the charges were
dismissed. There was obviously some difficulty, in such a case as this,
in getting at the truth of things. Ii we add to this the risk of appeal,
however frivolous‚ from the bishop's court to a higher tribunal, as in the
case of Richard Gray, or such an action as that of Luffenham in procur-
ing letters of absolution from a papal emissary in England, the bishop’s
chariness in asserting his authority will be more easily understood.
Where he had to deal with a monastery, the greatest caution was

¹ An instance in which Gascoigne’s hostility to statesman—prelates led him into partial
statement is his condemnation of John Kempe, archbishop of York 1425-52, for persistent
absenteeism. See Loci e Libro veritatum, ut sup.‚ pp. 36, 37. Kempe‘s register shows that,
although he was more often out of his diocese than in it and left much ofhis work to highly
competent commissaries‚ the statement that ‘aliquando semel in decem vel in duodecim
annis mansit in sua diocesi Eboracensi per duas vel tres septimanas’ is exaggerated. The
records of his visitations of the diocese and province of York, once in person and once by
commission‚ have been edited by the present writer in vol. cxxvu οἱ the publications of the
Surtees Society. Incidentally, Gascoigne's remark that Kempe was archbishop οἱ York
‘ per xxviij fere annos' contradicts the common error, noted in Visitatz'ons 1 (p. xv, note 9),
that his translation to York took place in 1426.

2 Loci e Libro veritatum, pp. 24, 25 : · Nuper enim per unum episcopum amor peccati
nutritur, quia parochiani unius ecclesie dixerunt: “Nunc credimus quod adulterium et
fornicacio nullum est peccatum, quia si esset peccatum episcopus noster privasset rectorem
nostrum a cura sua, quia episcopus novit quod rector noster publice captus est in adulterio
cum propria parochiana, uxore alterius viri, et tamen episcopus non expulit eum ab illa
cura-’¹ Et etiam Oxonia admisit eum postea ut esset doctor decretorum et ibi plures
violavit; et sic ex actu episcopi et ex actu Oxonie recipientis bonos et malos ad gradus
suppremos scolasticos secuta sunt plurima mala et audacia peccandi. Plures enim non
timent peccare quia non punitur peccatum in aliis hominibus, et quia non puniuntur,
credunt illud quod est peccatum non esse peceatum!
