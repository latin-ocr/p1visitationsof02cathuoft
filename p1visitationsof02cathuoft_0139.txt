THE VISITATION OF THE MONASTERY or BARDNEY, OF THE ORDER
OF sT. BENET, OF THE DIOCESE OF LTNcoLN‚ PERFORMED m THE
,CHAPTER-HOUSE THEREIN ON THE 8TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF
MAY, IN THE YEAR oE oun Lonn 1444, ΒΥ THE REVEREND FATHER
IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LoRD WILLIAM, BY THE GRAcE OF
Gon BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE 18T·H YEAR oF Hrs CONSECRATION

AND THE EIGHTH OF HIS TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the said business on andin the day and place before-
said, there appeared before him the abbot and convent of the said place
to undergo, as was apparent, such visitation3 and then the abbot delivered
to my lord the certificate of my lord's mandate addressed to him for the
performance of such his visitation, in these words : ‘To the reverend
[father] in Christ,' etc. And then, when those who had been summoned
had been called over, they all appeared except William Waynflete, who is
abbot of Humberstone‚1 and John Hawtone, who is abiding in apostasy.
And then the abbot shewed my lord the state of the house on the feast
of St. MichaeL in the year of our Lord 1438, in such matters as its
pensions and rents and farms.

Brother John Waynfiete, the abbot, says that brother William Yorke,
in the week when sometime he was priest and should have kept within
the cloister precinctS,2 went out to hunt with the abbot of Peterborough.
He appeared, and, on the article being laid to his charge, confesses that
he went out, with leave, however, from the prior, but says that he was
not present at the hunting; and it was enjoined upon him that within
three weeks he should say three nocturns of the psalms oi David.

Brother William Burghe‚ the prior, says that he himself is so old,
and the abbot so powerless because ot' 1113 infirmities, that by reason of
theirlincapacity the regular observances are not kept, nay, are set at
nau 11.
gBrother John Bracy says that brothers William Yorke and John
Hole do oft-times drink and eat in the town of Bardney, in Osgodby,⁸
and especially in the almonry farm hard by the monastery, and this con-
trary to my lord's injunction and almost of custom. It shall have a place
in the injunctions, because they confess the 6161311114ι

Also brother John Hole does eat in a certain booth by the water
with a certain married woman contrary to my lord’s injunction, and this
when he goes to the marsh⁵ for thatch. He denies the article, and
cleared himself on his own oath : he was acquitted on this count.

 

 

 

should be noted as adding to the weight of testimony against the inaccurate and illogical
theory that injunctions were merely formal documents.

⁵ Le. the reed-bed by the witham. The not very common word labina or lavina,
derived from labes=a slip‚ fall, literally means a slippery place, slipperiness. In the confir-
mation charter by Henry VI of Carman's spital in Folkton parish, Yorks. ER„ printed by
Dugdale‚ it is stated: ‘jamque diversi ligei nostri, juxta praedictum hospitale tempore
yemali et noctanter transeuntes, si ipsi ibidem hospitalitatem non haberent, in aquis,
lamnis, et mariscis saepissime periclitarentur.’ Ducange notes the survival of the word in
Ger. Lawine, Lauwine, the common term in Switzerland for avalanches of melted snow:
‘ lauwine loosen’d from the mountain’s belt ‘ (Byron, Chila’e Harold, IV, st. xii).
