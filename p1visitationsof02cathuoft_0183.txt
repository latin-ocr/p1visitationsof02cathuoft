XIII.

THE VISITATION OF THE MONASTERY OF CROYLAND‚ OF THE ORDER
OF ST. BENET‚ OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE OF THE SAME ON THE 18TH AND 19TH DAYs OF
THE MONTH OF JUNE, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1440, ΒΥ THE
WORSHIPFUL FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM,
BISHOP OF LlNcoLN‚ IN THE 14TH YEAR OF H1s CONSECRATION AND
THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

 

Upon and in the which 18th day of June, year and place aforesaid,
the aforesaid reverend father began to sit in his capacity of judge in the
business of such his visitation ; and then there'appeared before the same
reverend father the abbot and convent of that place, being gathered to-
gether, as was apparent, to undergo such visitation. But, before the
reverend father aforesaid might proceed further in such business first
and before all else the word of God was set forth in agreement with the
process about to take place by the man of religion brother Gilbert Mul-
tone,l monk of the same monastery, bachelor in sacred theology, after
this text, ‘This is the city of visitation '. And when this was finished in
very noble and excellent wise, and also they whom such business did not
concern had been sent away out of the said chapter-house, the abbot
delivered and gave over to the said reverend father the certificate of my
lord's mandate which had been addressed to him for the business of
such visitation, composed under this form, ‘To the reverend [father] ’,
etc. The which having been received and read through, the same lord

, abbot swore canonical obedience to the said reverend father in the
accustomed form. Then he shewed the certificate of the confirmation of
his own election‚² but not the letter of his installation, because he had it
not in readiness Thereafter he exhibited the primitive foundation-
charter of the monastery and also its restoration by Eadred, then king,
after it had been left solitary.⁸ And he exhibited also the state of the
said monastery and the injunctions made by the lord William Gray, late
bishop Of Lincoln,⁴ and also the foundation-charters of three chantries
to the maintenance whereof the monastery is bound.⁵ And, having
shewn these, the same abbot, being examined touching those things
which affect the state of the monastery in matters spiritual and temporaL

⁶ The two chantries of St. Martin and St. Pega in the monastery precincts are men-
tioned in Gray's injunctions (ibid., 1, 36). Probably the chantry of Peylonde was the third.
The identity of this with St. Pega's chantry, which was probably founded in her old cell to
the east of the abbey, has been assumed by the present editor (ibid., note 1), but it appears
from the detecta in this visitation that it was founded in a chapel at some distance from the
monaster .

⁶ Litlyngton is the mediaeval form of place-names known under the modern forms of
Litlington‚ Lidlington and Littleton. As none of these appear to have been connected with
Croyland, it is uncertain from which Of them the abbot of Croyland derived a name also
borne by the famous abbot of VVestrninster, Nicholas Litlington (1362-86). Litlington in
Cambridgeshire, near Royston, seems perhaps the most likely place. Among the thirty-one
monks who appeared at this visitation, there appears one other Cambridgeshire name,
Wisbech, from a part of the county much nearer Croyland. Thomas Waldene doubtless
came from‘Saffron Walden in Essex, where Benedictine influence was strong, owing to· the
neighbourhood of Walden abbey, one of the houses associated with Croyland in the Bene· ἢ
