FOTHERINGHAY COLLEGE, 1442 110

(The master.) Also he says there are no differences or quarrels
between the master and fellows, save only because the stipends are not
paid both [for] the celebration of masses, and for other due reasons,

(The master.) Sir John Palmere says that several of the fellows and
the others who are bound to quire, after they have come into quire, go
out directly of custom before divine service is finished, and this in the
master's default, for he suffers them so to go out and reproves them not
nor restrains them : [and] in the precentor's default when the master is
absent.

(The master.) Also he says that the master keeps back for himself
fourteen pounds, to wit out of their stipends and their other dues, and

also keeps back from him his livery for one year.

(The master.) Also he says that by the statutes of the college the
master should convey all the profits of the house to the college and lay
them by in one common chest under three locks, of which the master
should have one [key], the precentor another, and one of the college
chosen by the fellows, holding no other office, the third.¹ And Palmere
is nominated as the third man by all, and they were warned that the
keys should be kept on this wise within the next month‚

(The master.) Also he says that the master does not pay the
choristers their stipends and their other rights. The master confesses it.

(The master.) Also he prays that Thomas Salmon, late yeoman-
clerk‚ [be expelled], who on account of his ill way of life was expelled

’ἶ . from the college, and the master brought him back from London, and

the college is defamed by him in the town in that place. The master
was warned to expel him for ever.

(The master.) Sir William Thurleby says that the household and
its stewardship also are not well overseen to the advantage of the college
in the master’s default, and repairs in the college are ill done, nor is the
rectory-house of the church [kept in repair], nor is there any store kept
for doing repairs in timber and other needful matters.

(The master.) Also he says that according to the statutes and by
force thereos four of the fellows of the college should be present when
the master renders his account as regards the administration of the
goods of the college,² and now there are none thereat but the master and
auditor, and therefore naught is known of the profits of the house.

(The master.) Also he says that, when the master goes out about
the business affairs of the college, he causes manifold expenses that well-
nigh may not be borne: therefore he prays that the statutes may be
looked at as regards this,⁸ and also that the accounts may be examined,
because it is believed that they are not made up equally well, and he says
that in this way the college is going back and not faring well.

(The master.) Also he says that the master too often and for very
slight causes and with a too numerous household rides to London, and
stays there for an over-long time, to the great and useless charges of the
house 3 and he believes that the master knows not whether barley is
sown this year or how much. ’

² Statute 22 prescribes the attendance of the precentor and six senior fellows at the
audit of the annual balance-sheet, to take place within a month after Michaelmas.

⁸ Under statute 13, if the master neglected his duties by absence or carelessness, or
caused loss to the spiritualities or temporalities of the college, the precentor and a majority
of the fellows had power to invite him to resign, and, if he refused, to report him to the
bishop for deprivation, “ ’ ⁴
