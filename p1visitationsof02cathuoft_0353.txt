HUMBERSTONE ABBEY', 1440 140

etc. The which having been read through, the same lord abbot delivered
to my lord the foundation-charter of the house1 and left a copy thereos

, in the hands of the registrar. Thereafter he shewed to my lord the

certificate of the confirmation of his election, but not that of his installa-
tion²; nevertheless, these documents which he shewed, having been
negligently kept, are almost worn away but can anyhow be understood.
> And therefore he has a term, that he may have the register searched for
his title, so that he may have the needful letters of his title, on' this side
the feast of Easter next 3 and [he has] the afternoon of this day for
exhibiting the certificate of his installation and the state of the house or
monastery. And after these things the abbot sware obedience in the
form accustomed‚ and then, upon examination, the abbot, says these
things which follow. ,

Brother William West? the abbot, says that brothers William Kele,
John Clee, Thomas Gretham, Richard Halle and John Gouxhille, monks
of the house, have left the house in apostasy, of whom Clee is dead and
Gouxhille has made profession in one of the mendicant orders.

(Conspiracy.) Also he says that William Anderby and John Wrauby,
monks‚ are in league and conspiracy with one another against the abbot.
Anderby cleared himself of conspiracy with Fresshney t Wrauby cleared
himself with Anderby.

(Anderby.⁴) Also that this Wrauby said in public, after the

· abbot had received my lord's mandate for the visitation, ‘ Lo ! now must

and rebelliously‚ when [the abbot] took him to task for climbing up a
gate to behold the pipe-players and dancers in the churchyard of the
parish church 3 and he is disobedient almost in all things, saying that he
would never submit to the abbot’s correction in aught. He confesses.
the last part of the article and sware to perform penance, to wit, to ask
pardon of the abbot, the which also he did, and to say a nocturn of the
psalms of David within the next week ; and, as regards the first part of
the article, he confesses it.

(Anderby : all.) Also he says that every monk receives 16s. Sd. in
the year for his raiment, and yet no one of them will shew the abbot
what money he has at any time of the year ε therefore it is feared that they
are guilty of appropriation, and especially Anderby. Anderby sware
that he would shew what money he has to the abbot every year.

(All.) Also he says that, whenever he sits in chapter to make
corrections, they are rebellious to such a degree that they do not submit
to correction, and so great is the uproar that secular folk can hear thern
afar off, and therefore conclude that they are brawling among themselves,

(Gedeney.) Brother Thomas Fressheney says that brother John

¹ No copy of this appears to exist. There is no chartulary, and the monastery was
omitted from the early editions of Monasticon.

2 No record of these remains ς see Visitatwns 1, 72, note 1.

⁸ All the monks‚ except the abbot, appear under surnames derived from places in: Lin-

colnshire. Four of the five apostates also bore similar surnames‚ Gretham being probably
Greetham, near Horncastle.

⁴ This should be ⁴ Wrauby.'
