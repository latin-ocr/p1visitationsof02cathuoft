BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-8 14

And then, having received the purgatiori of brother Richard Parteney

, touching that which Bartone was said to have set him to do, that, while
he was subsacrist, he had broken open a chest in the sacristy and had
alienated the goods laid up therein, Bartone stoutly denying this instiga-
tion, my lord, having reserved to himself the power of making the

. necessary injunctions, of correcting and punishing the faults disclosed
and committed and of punishing offenders against the injunctions made
and to be made by him, dissolved such his visitation, Depyng, Thorpe
and I Colstone being present.

Brother John Waynflete, the abbot, being examined says that they
are sixteen in number, and of these he himself, the cellarer and the sub-
ν cellarer do not use to come to quire, [and] there is a fourth in the in-
firmary, and eight times a year, to wit once every week, there are four
in their seynies at Southrey,1 so that there are hardly eight monks left for
quire, and these do not come regularly to quire all the time, so that

’ sometimes quire is badly served.

Also he says that there are three establishments2 in the mouastery, to
wit, the abbot's hall, the infirmary and the frater3 and sometimes the
monks that do stay in the infirmary take their meals not together but

⁷ separater, to wit, one by himself, another by himself and a third by him-
self, and send their broken meat into the town whither they will, and so
the alms are wholly wasted.

Also he says that whatsoever guests come down to the monastery
are entertained in the guest-master's quarters, and not, as is the usual
custom‚ in the abbot's hall.

Χ* Also he says that long and many watchings are kept at night in the
guest—house in the infirmary,³ at which beer from the frater is consumed,
and this by monks who spend their time in such offences against disci-
pline⁴ and will not give them up.

Also he says that all day long they sit in the frater drinking and
spending their time in messes and drinkingS‚ as though it were a public
tavern, and to these they bring in secular folk.

Also he says that the monks too often make expeditioris into the
‚ town of Bardney‚ where for their ease they haunt the taverns to the
great scandal of the monastery.

(Against the sacrist.) Also the clerk of the sacristy receives under
the name of his livery seven brown loaves⁵ a week and seven gallons⁶ of
beer and seven stone of cheese a year, and twenty-eight herrings every
week in Lent, and nevertheless the sacrist sends him victuals from his
own allowance which ought to be spent in alms, and, as it is said, he

sells or at any rate uses up the said loaves in some other way.

Also he says that the church, manors, granges and tenements belong-
ing to the monastery are much dilapidated and stand in need of large
repairs.

Also he says that the monastery is many ways in debt, as is apparent
in the roll delivered to my lord.
