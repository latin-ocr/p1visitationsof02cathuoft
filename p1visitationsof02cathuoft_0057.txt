INTRODUCTION xlix

Colstone himself, was the fine series of injunctions in Flemyng's and
Gray's registers, the last word of the Lincoln chancery in this form of
composition.l But the necessities of composition required the adjust-
,ment of the common form to meet particular caseS. It must be
remembered that a bishop’s injunctions were of statutory importance:
they were not pieces of mild paternal advice, which the undutiful could
disregard lightly. They were delivered as peremptory mandates, includ-
ing a triple admonition and threatening the disobedient with summary
excommunication. They were not intended merely for a special
occasion, but were to be kept permanently as part of the law of the
convent. The art oi composing injunctions, therefore, was to translate
special cases into the terms of general application which were to be
found in the precedent-books. The least carefully composed injunctions
are those which contain allusions to individuals. With individuals it
was possible to deal separately by the methods already referred to 3 but

’ to censure them by name in injunctions was insufficient. Some monk

might be slack in coming to quire z if an injunction were levelled at him
by name, it would be quite within reason for a subsequent offender to
plead that the injunction had been confined to a particular place, time,
or person. What was needed was a form of language that, while cover-
ing the particular case, warned the convent in general ot their obligation
to attend divine service and of the perjury incurred by disregarding it.

Thus, the more general the language of injunctions is and the nearer
they keep to the common form, the better they are for practical purposes.
But this is a very different thing from calling injunctions merely formal
documents. When bishop Gray sent injunctions to Caldwell, Daventry,
Huntingdon and St. Neot's priories, he used one preamble, which is
given at'length in his register in the case ot Huntingdon, with references
to the Huntingdon document in the other cases.² The preamble was no
invention of Gray's: it was simply an arraignment ot a slack and
disorderly monastery, couched in stern and threatening language, an old
precedent re-used upon occasion, when a monastery needed a thorough
purging. So far as language goeS, it was a formal document, no doubt ;
'but it was not a mere circular sent round without special reference to
the condition ot those for whom it was intended. The moulds in which
injunctions were cast were of a venerable antiquity : they were used in
the legatine constitutions of Oddo and Ottobuono and may be traced in
their making to a still earlier period.³ Their utility had been well
proved : their phraseology had gradually been extended to quality most
of the besetting sins of religious men : and, when any such sin is made
the subject of an injunction, no matter how vague and general the
language may be, we may be sure that it had been noted during the
visitation which preceded the injunctions, and so called for definite
rebuke.

When we meet with a series of injunctions, such as those which
have been copied into Flemyng's and Gray's registers, we are apt, upon
comparing them, to note the extreme similarity of their contents. It is
this likeness, the repeated employment of phrases and entire clauseS,
