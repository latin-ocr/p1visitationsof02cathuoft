At and in the which term and place, as the said reverend father was
sitting in the beginning and exercise of the business of such his visita-
tion, there appeared before him in his capacity as judgel dame Clemence
Medforde,² prioress of the said place, and the other nuns thereos 3 and
then when request had been made of the same prioress by the said rever-
end father for the certificate of his mandate conveyed to the said prioress
for such visitation, the same prioress instead of the certificate delivered the
original mandate itselt' to the said reverend father, affirming that she did

&Nx-iot understand the mandate itself‚ nor had nor has she any man of ski'H
or other lettered person to instruct her what she should do in this behalf.
At length the same reverend father of his grace accepted this her excuse3
and hereupon, when the names and surnames of the several nuns had
been furnished by the same prioress ....... of such mandate [and]
written down, the same prioress shewed to my lord her preferment⁸ and
the mandate for her installation, but touching her installation she shewed
nothing. At length, after canonical obedience had been sworn by her to
the said reverend father in the accustomed form, the same prioress shewed
certain archives relating to the foundation of the house. Thereafter
she shewed a roll containing the rents of the house, which, after deduct-
ing rent-charges, reach the total ἐκ 63. 7d. Touching the stewardship
of the temporalities and touching the other receipts, as from the alms
and other like sources, she shews nothing, and says that at the time of
her preferment the house was three hundred marks in debt, and now is
in debt only forty pounds, and she declares some of the names of the
creditors of this sum. And thereafter being examined she says these
things which follow.

Dame Clemence Medforde, the prioreSS, says that the nuns are
sometimes moved against her on slight occasion.4

Also she says that the nuns do drink almost of custom every day
contrary to the rule, and do hold drinkings atter compline.

Dame Isabel Standene, the sub-prioreSS‚ says that all is well.
