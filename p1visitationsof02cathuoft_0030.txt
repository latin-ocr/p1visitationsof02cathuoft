of Bardney in face of ‘the candidate elected by the convent,2 had Aln-
wick's full concurrence. The rejected candidate had little to recommend
him but his zeal for spying upon offenders³ ; while Multon came from a
well-conducted house, where he had preached before the bishop in

44 Apart from these indications of his zeal for sound learning in
monasterieS, Alnwick’s interest in the educational activities of his a'ge is
shewn by his connexion with the royal collegiate foundations at Eton
and Cambridge. Eton lay within his jurisdiction on the southern edge
of his diocese, while the King’s college of St. Mary and St. Nicholas at
Cambridge was placed under his charge and that of his successors as
visitors. The two occasions on which he consecrated other bishops are
connected with the two 'colleges On 13 Oct., 1443, assisted by William
Ayscough, bishop of Salisbury, and Nicholas Ashby, bishop of Llandaff,
he consecrated Thomas Bekynton as bishop of Bath and Wells in the
old collegiate church of blessed Mary of Eton, close to which the new
church, nondum semz'constructa, in which Bekynton celebrated his first
pontifical mass, and the new chambers of the college, not as yet
condistincte subtus, were rising.⁵ On 7 May, 1447, in the chapel of King's
college—the older chapel, which served for the devotions of the college
for many years until the magnificent chapel, begun in 1446, was ready
for use,—-he consecrated John Langton, chancellor of the university and
master of Pembroke hall, who held the prebend of Empingham in
Lincoln, to be bishop of St. DavidS.⁶
Alnwick’s name is connected with two other institutions which,
though founded primarily for religious purposeS, had also, in common
with many chantry foundations of the age, their educational side. The
letters patent which sanctioned the erection of the parish church of
Tattershall into a collegiate church, bearing date 14 July, 1439, were
issued to Ralph Cromwell, knight, cardinal Beaufort, bishop Alnwick,
John Scrope, knight, Walter Hungerford, knight, Walter Tailbois, esq.,
and William Paston, as patrous of the church.⁷ Subsequently, on 24 Oct.,
1440, Alnwick, as diocesan, decreed the erection of the college, which
was confirmed by the pope on 16 Oct., 1441.⁸ The foundation consisted
of a master and six chaplain-fellows‚ six lay clerks and six choristers,
with thirteen bede-foll< : the statutes provided an endowment for a
grammar-master and song-master, whose duty it was to instruct the
choristers.⁹ The resemblance between this arrangement and the
foundation of Eton college in 1440, with its provost and fellows,
lay clerkS, choristers, grammar-master and almsmen, is obvious. The
educational provisions at Tattershall, however, did not include the poor
scholars who, as Henry vl’s plans for Eton developed, became the out-
standing feature of his scheme; and the Tattershall grammar-school
