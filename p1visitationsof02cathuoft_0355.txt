had rung the bells for matins, went back to bed without attending matins.
He confesses the first part of the article and sware to perform [pen-
ance]. He has for his penance to attend quire every night during next
Lent, and to be satisfied with one kind of fish every F riday,¹ and every
Friday to fast on bread and water, save two days whereon he may have
beer.

(The abbot ε he confesses.) Also he says that the abbot lies not in
the dorter (he confesses it), nor comes to matins save upon the principal
feasts (he confesses it), nor takes heed for religion or the divine offices
(he confesses it), and is careless in his corrections of the monks, and is
merely governed by Gedeney, his chaplain, by the butler and the cook,
by whose advice and in no wise by that of his brethren he does all things
(he denies it). He cleared himself hereos on his own unsupported oath.

(The abbot: he denies.) Also he says that as much of the victuals
of the monastery is consumed in the town as among the monks, and this
because the butler sends it. And [of this] also he cleared himself on his
own unsupported oath.

(Andrew.) Also he says that Andrew Palfrayman, a Scotchman, the
abbot's serving-man, brought in two light women and lodged them above
the sacristy² and laid them a bed there, to what end he says that he
knows not ; and when this had been disclosed to the abbot by Anderby,
he let it pass in silence nor did anything at all to correct it. And he says
that needs must be that this Andrew be sent away.

(The abbot : he confesses.) Also he says that the abbot‚ when this
deponent was absent, sold a corrody to one Wyldebore‚ for which he
received a hundred marks, and it is worth about ten marks a year (he
confesses it, with the consent [of the convent]) ; and he sold another to
William Puncharde‚ for which he received ten pounds‚ and it is
worth 33⁵· 4d.a year (he confesses it, but with the consent of the convent) ;
and another, when this deponent was present, to John Hoise, for which
he received twenty pounds, and it was worth four marks a year
(he confesses it) ; and another to Robert Howet of Normanby⁸ for
twenty pounds, and it was worth four marks a year (he confesses it,
with consent) 3 and another to Robert Howet, serjeant porter,⁴ while
this deponent was at Molycourt‚⁵ for eight marks, and it is worth
five nobles6 a year (he confesses it) 3 and another to Richard Bekeryng,
butler, for twenty marks, and it is worth 46s. 8d. a year (he confesses
it) ; and what has been done with these monies received is not known,
save only concerning sixteen marks received from Richard Botylere‚⁷
with which Anderby, at that time cellarer, paid the abbot's debts.

(The abbot : he confesses.) Also he says that the abbot has never
rendered an account in his time but once, and this was to master Thomas
Warde at his visitation in that place.⁸ He confesses it.

(All.) Also he says that silence is kept in no whit, nor do they eat
