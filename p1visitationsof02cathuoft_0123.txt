with beer and other victuals, contrary to the ordinance appointed by my
lord with the consent of all.

Brother John Bracy, having been sworn to speak the truth concern-
ing the inquiries to be made of him [and] being interrogated whether he
ever knew or heard Bartone say that lord Cromwell² would sweep the
floor⁸ or that his head would be cut off, says yes, and this was last winter

shall sweep the floor like the others who have dealt in the same office)
Asked whether he knew Bartone to make any [coin, he says] no.

says yes, and this was at divers times during meals in summer as well as
winter. Questioned in [whose] presence, he says that he does not know.

on a hurdle to their execution. Parteney's evidence indicates that the phrase meant that
Cromwell would come to a bad end.

4 The ordinary name given, as at Durhum, to the calefactorium or warming-house of a
Benedictine monastery. See note on calefactorium in Visitations 1, 222.

⁶ The MS. is much rubbed at this point, and the actual meaning is irrecoverable.

⁶ Neither of the Despensers, of whom the elder was hanged and the younger beheaded
