BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-8 12

such his inquiry that master Peter Par-tryche, late official of Lincoln
during the vacancy of the see, when he was visiting the said monastery
and found in such visitation that brothers John Rose, John Howton,
John Sallowe and william Bekeryng, monks of the said monastery, had
stayed, being expressly professed, for seven years in the said monastery
and had not yet fulfilled their profession as the order required, had
suspended them from every act of chapter and voice in chapter until
they fulfilled it, my lord in this his visitation, inasmuch as he found that
brother John Rose had made sufficient fulfilment, reinstated him in his
former liberty and restored him to all chapter [acts and] to his voice
and vote in chapter. And as for the other three, it was his will that they
should stay as he found them, and, because they shewed themselves neg-
lectful in fulfilling their profession, it was his will and ordination that, over
and above the penalty aforesaid, they should be content with one kind of
fish and one kind of flesh in their several diets until they should have
made complete fulfilment. He ordained moreover that none of the

‘ monks should go out of the monastery without having first asked and

obtained leave for a reasonable and lawful cause, or in any wise drink or
eat in the town of Bardney, or bring any woman howsoever honest into
the cloister precincts, or, if a woman be brought in by anyone, receive
her into any familiar converse, such women alone excepted as concerning
whom the laws presumo that no evil can be suspected. And as regards
the governance of the abbot and convent in matters of meat and drink,
my lord gave them the choice, whether they would eat together in one
building at the common charges of the monastery and put their serving-
men, stopping the liveries which they receive, at the common board of
the monastery, or that each several monk should be placed upon a
certain allowance and that they should so live in common, getting rid of
their useless serving-folk, such, to wit, as in this case should not be
necessary. Touching this matter, then, the abbot asked leave to delib-
erate, which my lord granted until after breakfast, so that in the mean-
time he should take counsel with his brethren ; and then they all went
to the mid-day meal. After the which the same reverend father returned
to the said chapter-house, and sitting in his capacity of judge as a tribunal
in that place in the business of his said visitation, asked of the abbot
whether he had yet taken deliberation concerning the choice of the two
ways of diet. And he and all the monks of the monastery who were then
present in the same place, save him who was sick, said that, if it pleased
his lordship, they have chosen rather to stay in one building and at one
table together at the common cost of the monastery and to put their
serving-men at the common board of the monastery, suppressing their
liveries which they receive from the monastery 3 to the which way my
lord assented, saying that he was willing to try them, after what manner
they should behave themselves in this way . . . . so long as it should be
his pleasure. And then Bartone cleared himself with brothers William
Burghe and William Croyland. Lincolne and Croyland cleared them-
selves and were bound over, in what manner soever they hitherto have
behaved themselves as regards late drinkings, henceforth to leave off
their use. Brother Richard Parteney cleared himself with brothers
William York and William Langtofte. John Hole cleared himself of
both articles with Langtofte, Elkyngtone and Parteney. Bracy cleared
himself with York, Croylande and Parteney. And then my lord announced
them to be lawfully cleared and restored them to their good fame.¹ And
