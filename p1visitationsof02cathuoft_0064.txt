silence which follows was obliged to be satisfied. There is no record
of the date when Luffenham quitted his canonry, but he presumably

held it for a few years longer.
In this case, a man who was clearly convicted of an assault upon

one of his fellow-canons and of irregular celebration of divine service in
the sequel evaded the penalty by resorting to a foreign source of pardon,
while the ordinary, who had proper cognisance of the case, was left
powerleSS, or at the most with a remedy which it would have been
expensive and profitless to pursue. The difficulty of the summary treat-
ment of offenders is illustrated by the case, this time of a layman, which
came before Alnwick at Wellingborough, on the very day on which
Luffenham appeared there. Richard Gray, the paramour of Elizabeth
Willoughby, the nun of St. Michael's already mentioned, confessed his
guilt and forswore all communication with the priory and with her. The
bishop ordered him to do penance publicly on four Sundays or feast-
days in St. Mary’s, Stamford, after the usual form, and to be whipped
round the church, and similarly to do penance in the market-place on
four Fridays. He was also to ride to Lincoln within the next month,
walk barefoot to the city from the fifth milestone and offer a wax taper
at the high altar of the minster. His penance in the market-place was
commuted, on his petition, to the payment of twenty shillings to the
convent and a like payment to the fabric-fund of Lincoln minster. The
bishop's commissary then removed the sentence of excommunication.
Gray, however, instead of fulfilling his oath to perform the penance in
this modified form, appealed to the court of Arches, and proceedings
against him were stayed until the bishop had obtained a licence from
the archbishop's official to go on with the case. On 15 November
following, when Luffenham presented his letter from the pope's collector
to Depyng at Buckden, Gray appeared by proxy, pleading that he him-
self was ill of a sever which kept him in bed every other day and
prevented him from coming. Accordingly, the case was again put off,
and the end of it, if it came to an end at all, is uncertain.¹

If, therefore, we are inclined to think that penalties were too light
and purgations too easy, and that a more severe treatment of faults would
have worked the reformation which visitations were powerless to effect,
it is necessary to remember that a diocesan bishop was not in command
of an all-sufficient machinery with which to execute his purposeS. The
two instances cited above prove how difficult it was to bring a defaulter
to book in the spiritual courtS, even where he was treated with lenience
and in strict accordance with the forms of law. Against them may be
set the case of John Dey. the canon of the Newarke college at Leicester,
who-was convicted on clear evidence of a repulsive crime and was
depnved after short and summary procedu1-e.2 Dey's guilt, however,
was quite exceptional : he had degraded himself beyond hope of absolu-
t1on, and no appeal could have succeeded in restoring him to the
canonry wh1ch he had forfeited. It is nevertheless significant that he
was not deprived of the living which he held outside Leicester, although
he re51gned it shortly afterwards ε and it is obvious that a secular canon
who held other benefices might contrive, if he was expelled from one, to
