occurrence of Lincoln (7 August), and by that of Sewstern again on the

return Journey (9 August).
After 1 September, 1443, the limit of the second visit to London

Just mentioned, there occurs a series ot up-and-down journeyingS, which

” may be summarised thus ε

September, 1443. 4, Buckden 3 9-18, Liddington 3 22, Sleaford 3
24, Nettleham.

October, November, 1443. 5, Liddington : 10, Bedford 3 13, Et0n13
16, October-29 November, London. There is a non—personal date from
Buckden on 31 October, and one, probably personal, from Wooburn on
2 November.

December, 1443. 2, Buckden 3 4-31, Liddington.

January, 1443-4. 1, Liddington 3 5, 6, Ampthill 3 9-17, Liddingt0n3

, 22, Sleaford. These dates, in view of the fact that Alnwick was certainly

'in Cambridge at the beginning of February, are somewhat suspicions.
The visit to Ampthill is unexplained, unless it was a stage on the way to
London or Cambridge3 and the Sleaford date can hardly refer to the
bisho himself.

Ppebruary, 1443-4. 1. 2, Cambridge ; 3, Huntingdon3 6, Sleaford.
From this time until at any rate 9 May, 1444, Alnwick was in Lincoln-
shire, chiefly at Nettleham. On 1 and 9 May he was at Lincoln, in the
chapter—house, and on 8 May he visited Bardnev abbey.

The summer of 1444 is a difficult period. After 9 May the register
gives the following dates: 13 May, London; 14 May, Sleaford and
Wooburn (quite incompatible)3 16—23 May, Sleaford 3 28 May, Lidding-
ton and Nettleham (incompatible again), 4 June, Liddington3 10, 11
June, Buckden 3 14, 15 June, London ; 17 June, Banbury 3 18, 20 June,
London 3 26 June, London ς 28 June, W'ooburn 3 30 June, London. The
July dates are ; 3, 6, London 3 15, Wooburn 3 17, Liddington: 20-29,
Buckden. August: 1-9, Buckden316-22, Wooburn3 28-31‚ London.
September: 5-16, Buckden; 17-26, Liddington. October is a month ot
discrepancies: 1, Buckden; 13, Nettleham3 15, Nettleham and Buck- ·
den 3 16, Nettleham and Sleaford 3 18, Sleaford 3 22, 23, Buckden 3 24-
29, London. Reading this evidence carefully, the most likely solution,
to which the Banbury date of 17 June gives a clue, is that the bishop
left Sleaford in May, proceeded to Liddington or Buckden, and then,
travelling across country by Northampton and Banbury, took up his
residence at Wooburn about the end of June. He may have moved to
Buckden in September, but there is a date from Wooburn as late as
3 November.

There can be little doubt, however, that after 8 November Alnwick
left either Wooburn or London for Buckden (12-20 November), and that,
in spite of an intrusive date from London, he reached Liddington on or
about 23 November and spent Christmas there. On 31 December he
was at Sleaford.

For 1444-5 the dates are straightforward. January ε 2-12, Sleaford 3
15-30, Nettleham. February ε 13-18, Sleaford 3 24, 25, Buckden 3 26,
