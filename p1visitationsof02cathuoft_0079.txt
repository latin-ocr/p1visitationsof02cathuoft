ANKERWYKE PRIORY‚ 1441 2

[1.] Dame Margery Kyrkeby1 says that all the houses and buildings
within the priory are going to ruin, and three useful and needful houses
are utterly thrown to the ground by reason of the carelessness and
negligence of the prioreSS, to wit the sheepfold, which was consumed
by the fault of the prioress, who was then at a wedding at Bromhall² ;
another house wherein dairy stuff is made ; 3150 3 barn of which the
timber, because it was not gathered together, is now burned up. She
confesses being at the wedding ; she confesses the burning, also the rest

of the article.⁸

[2.] Also that the prioress alone keeps and all her time has kept the
common 5631 of the house, so that she can do therewith whatever she
will, without the knowledge and advice of the nuns. She confesses that
she alone has kept the 5631 in her turn for seasons, years and days, and
sometimes with other her fellow-nuns, so long as there have been any

of discretion in that place.

[3.] Also the vestments were wont to be of great mark and many in
number z where they are gone or whether they be there is not known ;
it is believed, however, that „they are alienated from the house. She
ι says that there abide in the house all things that she received from the
last prioress, touching the which she shews a schedule respecting the
delivery of the vestments and jewels.

[4] Also they used to have four chalices, and now not even one is
in their possession.⁴ She confesses that there were four, whereof two
were in the house ε the third is in pawn to Thomas Stanes [with the
consent of the convent] : the fourth has been broken up, also with the
*⁷ consent of the convent.

[5.] Also the prioress caused a silver censer and a silver 01131106,
the heaviest which they had, to be broken up to make a cup for
use at table ; and she gave the chalice and censer as broken silver
to one brother William Tudyngtone, a monk of Chertsey, that he
might take order for the making of the aforesaid cup thereof ; and
because the prioress had been given to understand that he had paid for
the making of the chalice⁵ . . . . and she had not wherewith to pay
him, such cup remains in the hands of the said monk. She confesses
the article, but she first had communication, as she avers, with the con-
vent, who all say that treaty was not held in chapter touching this, nor
was the consent of all had, but only that the more part had no knowledge
of the deed before it was done.

[6.] Also she says that there used to be beautiful psalters kept in
the house, ten in number, certain whereof the prioress 1135 given away
and alienated. She confesses that she lent three, one to the prioress of
Bromhall: she denies [that she did it] without the consent of the
conven .

[7.] Also that in the year last past in a place called ‘ly parkis,' two
miles distant from the priory, she sold a hundred oaks under no compulsion
