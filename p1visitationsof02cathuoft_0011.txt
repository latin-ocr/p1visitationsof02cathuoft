PREFACE

In preparing this series of visitation records for publication, the
editor has presented the text of the original MS. in a fully extended
form, adding punctuation for the sake of clearness, and suppressing
unnecessary capital letters which, used in a purely arbitrary fashion,
disfigure the printed page. The only omission which, after taking com-
petent advice, he has thought it advisable to make is that of a portion of
an examination of witnesses made at the Newarke college, Leicester, in
December, 1440, relating to the peculiarly heinous crime of which John
Dey, one of the canonS‚ stood accused. The nature of this evidence
and the reason for its exclusion will be sufficiently understood by a
reference to page 197 below. In places where the MS. is torn or faded
beyond possibility of restoration, but the lost words can be supplied with
reasonable certainty, they are given within square brackets, Marginal
notes are placed within curved brackets ; while inter-lineations and
marginal interpolations, as is more fully noted in the introduction, are
printed in italics. Cancelled words and passages and editorial correc-
tions of the text are given in the foot-notes to the Latin. ·

The English translation throughout has been made with the aim of
a literal reproduction of the meaning of the original, and, where slight
amplifications have been necessary, the added words have been put in
square brackets. A very few passages, where translation seemed un-
desirable, have been left unt-tanslated, andare indicated by dots or
asterisks. It is hoped that the somewhat copious annotations will be
found to contribute to the understanding of the difficult passages and the
historical and local allusions with which the text aboundsY

A few supplementa-ry documents which relate to special monasteries
have been added to tsshe‘ visitations of the houses concerned from bishop
Alnwick’s official register. The register is not rich in such documents ;
and all that it contains of this kind is printed in these volumes, the
second of which will appear as soon as it can be conveniently printed
and will contain a full index.' · Δ .. - ’

The editor desires to return his grateful thanks to those friends who
have aided him with their counsel and assistance, and chiefly to Canon
Foster, F.S.A., the secretary of the Lincoln Record Society and the inde-
fatigable helper of all who work for it ; to Mr. W. W. Smith, secretary
to the bishop of Lincoln and keeper of the records in the Alnwick
tower ; and to Mr. William Brown, F.S.A., and Mr. G. G. Coulton‚ who
have read the proofs and have been unfailingly ready to further the
elucidation of knotty questions. He has had the advantage of Sir
William St. John Hope’s minute knowledge of the remains and customs
of individual houses ; while Miss Eileen Power of Girton college, Cam-
bridge, and Mr. Harold Brakspear, F.s.A., have read the portions of the
work relating to nunneries and to Bardney abbey respectively and have
added details to the noteS. He would also thank the Rev. L. F. Hake‚
