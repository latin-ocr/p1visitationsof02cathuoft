BREEDON PRIORY, 144o-1 43

sometime visitation of the said priory we plainly discovered that the same,
we know not by what authority, but without our knowledge, was burdened

¹ by and with a yearly pension of four pounds of English money, to be

paid yearly for the term of his life to brother William Horbury‚ late the
prior of the same priory. Wishing therefore that provision be made with
greater deliberation for the immunity from damage of the same priory,
which under the governance of the said brother william, what time he bore
rule over the same, did not only suffer grievous ancl almost irreparable
ruin, as is evident to the sight, in its buildings, but also remains bound to
diverse creditors by a burden of debt beyond its strength, sO that of
likelihood the place will have no prosperity in our days; but having com-

, passion with fatherly kindness upon the old age of the same brother

William, we ordain, decree, appoint and dispose by our authority as
ordinary that, beside the victuals which you shall minister to the same
brother william at your board or elsewhere, as you shall see expedient,
you do pay him yearly for the term of his life, under the name of a yearly
pension, forty shillings only, faithfully laying out the forty shillings
remaining out of the said four pounds upon the repair of the buildings
of the same priory ; and concerning this we will that you render us an
account at the end of every year following our said visitation. Given
under our seal, etc.

THE VISITATION OF THE PRIORY OF CANONS ASHBY, OF THE ORDER
OF ST. AusTm, OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER·HOUSE ON THE 13TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF JULY, IN
THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1442, ΒΥ THE REVEREND FATHER IN

- CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD [WILLIAM], BY THE GRACE OF
GOD BISHOP OF LINCOLN‚ IN THE 16TH YEAR OF H1s CONSECRA-
TION AND THE SIXTH oF H1s TRANsLATmN.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge as a tribunal in the business of such his visitation, on
and in the day and place aforesaid, there appeared before him the prior
and convent Of the said place, in readiness, as was apparent, to undergo
such visitation 3 and then, first and before all else, the word of God was
set forth in the Latin tongue, in accordance with the process about to
take place, by the honourable master John Beverley, professor of holy
writ,1 after this text, ⁴ Have peace, and may the God of peace be among
you,' etc. And when this was done, the prior shewed to the said reverend
father the certificate of the mandate which had been addressed to him
for the undergoing of such visitation, in these wordS, ‘To the reverend,'
etc. The which having been read through, the prior shewed to the said
reverend father the certificates of the confirmation of his election and his
installation1 and the foundation [of the house]2; and then he sware fealty
and obedience. He exhibited also the state of the house, wherein, to wit,
he found the house at the time Of his entry and that wherein it now is,
and touching this my lord said that he would fain take‘counsel. And
then my lord proceeded to his preparatory inquiry after this form.
