against the canons, nor does he reprove them in aught, but rather
chides the canons,

when they complain of the serving-folk, but rather reviles them insomuch
that the same serving-folk do eall the canons knaves.

(The prior.) No teacher is kept in the same place to instruct the
canons in grammar z therefore they do not understand what they read.

THE VISITATION OF THE PRIORY OF ELSHAM‚ OF THE ORDER OF
ST. AUSTIN, OF THE D1OcESE OF L1NCOLN, PERFORMED m THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE ON THE 14TH DAY OF THE MONTH OF
JULY‚ IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1440, BY THE REVEREND
FATHER 1N CHRIST AND LORD, THE LORD W1LL1AM, BY THE GRACE
OF GOD BISHOP OF LINCOLN, IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR OF H1s
CONSECRATION AND THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

As the said reverend father was sitting in his capacity of judge in
the said business of his visitation, on and in the day and place aforesaid,
there appeared before him the prior and four canons of the said house ;
and then first and before all else the word of God was set forth by the
worshipful master Thomas Duffelde‚ bachelor in divinity, after this text,
⁴ Let the lambs be fed after their order ', etc, And when this was done,
the prior delivered to my lord the certificate of my lord's mandate which
had been addressed to him, the said prior, for such visitation ; the which
. having been read after these words, ‘To the right reverend ', etc„ the
said prior shewed my lord the attestatory letter of his confirmation, but
not of his installation1. He exhibited also the foundation charter of the
house made by one Awtvyle, the first founder? He exhibited also a copy
of the state of the house as regarded receipts 3 and then the prior sware
{ormal obedience‚ and thereafter on examination says those things which

Ollow.

Brother William Cliftone, the prior⁸‚ says that there is no canon in

the same place who is learned in religious discipline, and since they are

william and Elias, confirmed and endowed the hospital of our Lady and St. Edmund‚
founded by his mother Beatrice, ‘ad hospitalitatem per canonicorum administrationem
eaupgrgtpsshxssassalhtgh'gnalitutrhis visitation, one, Appelby‚ bears a local place-name. Appleby
lies north-west of Elsham‚ on the opposite side of the Ancholme valley. Bartone may
conceivably be Barton-on—Humber‚ which is only a few miles away ; but, like Cliftone‚ the
name is too common to be identified with certainty.
