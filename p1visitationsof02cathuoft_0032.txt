xxiv INTRODUCTION

A further memorial of Alnwick is found in the episcopal manor-
house at Liddington, Rutland, still fortunately preserved as a bede-house.
The present structure, on the site of a house whose history went back to
the days of St. Hugh, is entirely a fifteenth-century buildmg and is
usually ascribed to the ‚time of bishops Russell (1480-94) and Smith
(1496-1514), on the strength of the shield of arms over the fireplace of
the hall and the shield and motto which occur in a portion ot the stained
glass, While, however,'=lthese later bishops probably added to the
embellishment of the building, a large portion of the old stained glass in

the windows belongs to the time of Alnwick. The upper part of the
window of the great chamber at the west end of the hall has forits

groundwork quarries on which are figured conventional lilies with triple
cup-like heads and a similar blossom projecting from each side of their
stems. Some of these are crossed by a scroll bearing Alnwiek's motto,
Delectare in Domino, andjhis arms, silver a mill-rind cross sable‚ occur in
the oblong panels othhe borders of all four lights.² In the second light
is a kneeling figure of a prelate. in alb, mitre and a dark-red eope
bordered with white and lined with gold. His hands are clasped, and
an archiepiscopal cross, swathed in a sudary, is carried in the crook of
his right arm. From his breast ascends a scroll with the mutilated
legend . . . . regno residens 0 digna patrona . . . . 0 paradisi
gaudia dona. The window has been much patched and the general
composition, which included another prelate's figure, of which the
crosier-head remmus, and one or more angels, cannot be recovered. It
is probable that the lost figure, which carried a scroll with the words Ο
[l]ux prefulgens . . . . redemisli . . . [sine] fine manens . .
. . memorare, represented Alnwick‚ while the kneeling archbishop is
possibly intended for St. Thomas of Canterbury or Alnwiek's patron St.
William of York. The quarries and border occur in two of the windows
of the hall, and it seems likely that, while Russell or Smith completed
the glazing, the remodelling of the fabric of the house was begun by
Alnwick, with whom it was certainly a favourite residence.

Alnwick made his will at Buckden in October, 1445. 1t was proved
at Lambeth on 10 Dec.‚ 1449, five days after his death. A copy remains
iti-archbishop Stafford’s register‚2 with the marginal title ‘Testamentum
Willelmi Alnewyke, Lincolniensis episcopi.' For the convenience of the
general reader, the text is given here in a translation, the Latin, where
necessary,{being added in the notes below the page.

In the name of the most high and undivided Trinity, the F ather
and Son and Holy Spirit, and of the most glorious virgin and mother
saint Mary, of St. Hugh and the whole heavenly host‚⁸I William
Alnewyke, by the sufferance alone of God bishop of Lincoln, most
unworthy, being by the mercy of Jesus Christ sound of mind and
body, considering that by the laws of nature and mankind no limit
is more surely fixed than death and none more uncertain than the
hour ofgdeath, and desiring therefore to prevent that uncertain hour
