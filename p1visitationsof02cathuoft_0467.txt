¹ having been called by name and appearing in person before the same
reverend father, on and in the same day and place, the same reverend
father rehearsed to him the whole of his process held by him against the
same master John, and how he appointed him the same term and place
to hear the same reverend father's final pronouncement, proclamation and
decree in respect of the premises. And when all these things had been
acknowledged by the same master John, the same reverend father
proceeded to his pronouncement and proclamation under this form, ⁶ In
the name of God, amen‚' eto, as [is written] on the other side of this
leaf,¹ and decreed that notice should be given of such voidance to the
lord king, those being present as above. And then the same reverend
father appointed to the same master John the Saturday next after the
feast of our Lord’s Epiphany next to come² in the prebendal church of
Liddington, of the said diocese, before the same reverend father or his
commissary, to receive and do further in respect of the premises and by
reason thereos what the sacred canons and the decrees of the holy fathers
may prescribe and decree as regards the premises, [the same persons]
being present as in the last place above.

In the name of God, amen. We William, by divine permission bishop

bend and prebendary of the seventh prebend of the new collegiate church
of blessed Mary of Leicester, of our diocese, when we were in the act of
visiting the said collegiate church by our right as ordinary, were revealed
and accused to us, in our preparatory inquiry made by us at the time of
such our visitation, of that damnable and hateful vice of sodomy, by <the
name whereof alone the air is defiled, committed in damnable wise by
you, as it was said, withssdivers persons, and that, according to the ‘special
inquiry specially made by us in this behalf, after special summons of you
hereunto by us, and after observance of what should be observed in this
behalf and maintenance of the order of law and justice requisite in this
behalf‚ you were pronounced and proclaimed by us to be convicted and
to be held convicted of the same crime, and had this term and place
given you in form of law by our appointment beforehand to hear the
final sentence, proclamation, pronouncement and decree in respect of
and touching the premises, do pronounce‚ decree and proclaim you meet
to be deprived of and finally removed from the same canonry and prebend
and possession thereof by reason of the enormity and to the abhorrence
of such crime, and, by this our definitive sentence which we pass in these
writings, do deprive and finally remove you in manner of sentence and
definitively also in these writings.
