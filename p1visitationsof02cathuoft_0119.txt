BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-8 22

For it is unseemly that a monk should be busied about the washing of
such vessels. Let provision be made of a waiting-man.

(For the receipt of guests.) Also he prays that, when the monks'
friends come down to visit them, the same monks may have the common
guest-house of the monastery, wherein they may give entertainment to
the same their friends. Provision shall be made concerning this,1

(For Yorke.) Also he prays that my lord will intercede for him
with the abbot, that he [the abbot] may be a kind and indulgent father
to him.

(Against Lincolne and Croyland.) Brother John Sallowe says that
brothers Henry Lincolne and William Croyland are so given to drinking
after compline that, when they corneto matins, they are so oppressed with
sleep that they hinder all who are singing the psalms in quire. They
have a term after nones to clear themselves with [two monks] apiece.

(Against Parteney.) Also he says that brother Richard Parteney is
guilty of private gain, in that, having sheep, COWS, oxen and pigS, he sells
them and buys others in return, [and] converts them to his own use and
not that of the monastery. He denies the article ε he has a term after
-nones to clear himself with two monks.

(Against Lincolne and Parteney.) Also he says that the said brothers
Henry and Richard spend their time at night in playing dice, by reason
of which they do not come to matins. Henry [denies it. Richard]
abjured [the offence] and swore [to discontinue it.] It was enjoined
him that within a fortnight he should say the first nocturn of the psalter.

(Against the abbot.) Also he says concerning the injunctions
[made] by the last lord bishop, that they are not shewn publicly nor

observed.

“ (For the chantries and the mass for the king.) Also he says as above
concerning the chantries, and says that there should be a mass celebrated
daily for the king in the monastery, to celebrate which the monks in
priests' orders are sworn, and yet there are some [who do not], and
brother John Hole in special has withdrawn himself from the celebration
of the same mass. He has a term to clear [himself] with three monks,

Also he says that the young monks have none to shave thern but one
another: it often happens that because for such reason they come late
to quire the high mass is celebrated without music.2

(Against Hole.) Also he says that brother John Hole is defamed of
adultery with Jane Raven, a married woman, of Bardney. He denies
the article. He has a term after nones for clearing [himself].

(Against Bracy.) Also brother John Bracy was defamed [of adultery]
with Ellen Coke, a married woman, now of Tumby. He denies the
article : he has a term after nones for clearing himself with three

monks .
[ (Ag]ainst the abbot's serving-folk.) Two youths that dwell with the
abbot, one Barkeworthe and the other TaylboyS, do scold the younger
monks, [and Taylboys] drew his knife to strike'brother John Roos‚⁸ and
thley are encouraged to this, but he knows not by what persons or
w om.

'(Against Bartone.) Also he says that the monks are without satis-
faction in the payment of spices and knives⁴ by certain officers, to wit,
the almoner, the pittancer, [etc.].
