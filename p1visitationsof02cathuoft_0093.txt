¹⁹ Le. put in pawn. Cf. Chaucer, Cant. Tales, Α 1218: ⁸ Let him be war, his nekke
lyth to wedde.’ The injunction is founded on detecta 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.

²⁰ See detectum 9.

2¹ The injunctions sor Legbourne priory (3 July‚ 1440) will be found in their proper
place among the various visitations which follow.

¹ This visitation (ff. 32-35d. and 39) 'nas no title in the MS. It consists of (1) a full
account of the process on f. 32 and d.‚ extending over 26 and 27 January, 1437-8‚ and 13
and 19 March following; (2) the detailed detecta of the abbot and monks obtained on 26
Janumy, ‚⁰¹¹ ff. 33-35d.; (3) details of the purgatiori of monks accused of various faults.
already given in the account of the process, on f. 39; and (4), also on f. 39, some new
details, hitherto not given, with the evidence of the monks as to certain charges against the
sub-cenaret. The edges and margins of the MS. are much rubbed and torn and are in

places quite illegible; but in most cases the lost words or words approximating to them
may be conjectured without difficulty.

¹ Le. 1437-8.
