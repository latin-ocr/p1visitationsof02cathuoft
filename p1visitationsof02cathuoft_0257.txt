ation‚ when she was installed by authority of the archdeacon‚² concerning
which she shews no certain evidence. She was therefore enjoined to be
instant with the archdeacon’s official, to obtain the certificate of such
installation. And then the prioress sware obedience ; and then the
prioress was enjoined to restrain her muns, so far as she can, from having
any speech with the women who were then lodging in that place, or
with them that have access to them. She says that the same who now
is lodging there is the mother of sir John Pygot,² and she occupies a hall
and a chamber³ and pays nothing, save only that she repairs the build-
ings wherein she dwells.

Dame -Margaret Redynges‚4 the prioress, says that all things are well,
save that the house is poor and is in need of repair : yet in so far as·they
are able they make good defects whenever such befall them. ,

Dame Alice Pounfreit complains of the poverty of the house: in
other respects all things are well.

Darne Ellen Langwathe says all things are well.

Dame Clemence Kyrkeham says that all things are well: yet they
all do still complain of the poverty of the house ; and she says that they
receive nothing from the house save meat and drink only.

Dame Joan Leke agrees with the aforesaid.

Darne Joan Barnabee says that all things are well.

And when these had been examined and called together a second
time, my lord dissolved this visitation.

THE VISITATION OF THE COLLEGE OF BLESSED MARY AND ALL SAINTS
OF FOTHERINGHAY‚ OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN‚ BEGUN
AND PERFORMED IN THE CHAPEL OF BLESSED MARY WITHIN THE
SAID COLLEGE IN LIEU OF THE CHAPTER-HOUSE OF THE SAME,⁵
ON THE 23RD DAY OF THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER‚ IN THE YEAR
OF OUR LORD 1438, BY THE REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST AND
LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM, ΒΥ THE GRACE OF GOD BISHOP OF
LINCOLN, IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR OF HIS CONSECRATION AND
THE THIRD OF HIS TRANSLATION.

eventually, condemned to do public penance in Doddington church for five successive Sun—

days. William Cortyng, one of his serving—men‚ incurred a similar penance ior violence

and threats against John Gudwyn, vicar of St. Mary-le-Wigsord. The Pigots also gave

their name to Thorpe Pycot‚ now called Thorpe—on-the-Hill, not sar from Doddington.

³ The hall and great chamber or ‘bower’‚ the essential constituents of a mediaeval
dwelling (cf. Chaucer, Cant. Tales B 4022), as may be seen clearly in the twelfth-century
manor-house at Boothby Pagnell, near Grantham. It is possible that lady Pygot occupied
a guest-house. T'ne remains of the guest-houses at Fountains and Kirkstall illustrate the
hall and great chamber arrangement in such buildings. Or two chambers in the western
cloister range may have been fitted up for her accommodatiori.

4 The names of the nuns convey no very certain information as to their origin. Lang-
wathe is probably Langworth‚ near Lincoln, which is found in this form. Pounfreit is
Pontefract in Yorkshire, and Redynges is a name originally derived from Reading (Rad-
inges). Kyrkeham and Leke are too common for identification ; while Barnabee is probably
a variant of Barnby or Barmby‚ again uncertain. Margaret Barneby was the name ot a
previous prioress in 1410 (Visz'tations Ι, 159)

⁵ The eastern portion and the collegiate buildings of the church of Fotheringhay no
longer remain, and the position οἱ the Lady chapel and chapter-house are unknown. lt is
possible that the use of the chapter-house was inconvenient in 1438 owing to the build—
ing operations which were probably still going on at this date. The famous contract for
the building of the nave and tower (Monasticon VI (3), 1414 sqq.) bears date 24 Sept„ 1434.
