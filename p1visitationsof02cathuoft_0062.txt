lviii INTRODUCTION

Richard Harleton, the prior, was in particular a trustworthy and con-
scientious person, who appears to have won Alnwick's confidence and
respect. There were troublesome monkS, like the unruly Gosberkyrk,
and abbot Assheton certainly began his rule under a cloud ; but the
general conductos the house seems to have contrasted very favourably
with the laxity and scandals which prevailed in the equally important
abbey ot Ramsey about 1439.¹ NevertheleSS, the monastery needed
careful supervision, and the three visitations show that the division of
revenue between the abbot and convent was a source of continual heart-
searching, and that, in spite of all that a bishop could do or say, the old‘
problem of the abbot's personal control of his funds was always liable to
revive. St. Michael’s‚ on the other hand, which was in the patronage of
the abbot of Peterborough and had in times gone by been supervised by
one of the monks as warden of the nunnery, was small and poor. There
is no indication of any capacity upon the part of any oi its members ε
like all nunneries, it was peculiarly exposed to external temptation, and
the three visitations prove that it was in a state which made internal

reform impossible without drastic alteration.

Even in the more important houses, the bishop's task was hard. We
have only one visitation of Ramsey, belonging to the earlier years of
Alnwick's rule, and we have no means of discovering how far the
convent profited by a series of much needed and singularly elaborate
injunctions. The documents relating to Bardney, however, which will
be found in the present volume, are examples of the difficulty experi—
enced in dealing with a monastery in which, under a weak abbot, the
monks were divided into two opposite camps and were unable, even
where they shared the same antipathies, to trust one another. Here the
experiment was tried of introducing new blood from other houses We
have seen already how a prior was brought for a time from Spalding ;
and how when abbot Waynflete died, his successor was a well-learned
monk from Croyland.2 It is satisfactory to note, however, that, among
the quarrelling monks of Bardney, Alnwick found one' who, untouched
by any complaint, was suitable for the task of administering the decrepit
monastery of Humberstone, and appears to have done his work well.³
An opposite case to Bardney is that of the famous abbey of Austin
canons at Leicester.⁴ Here the abbot, John Sadyngton, was strong and
overbearing. He had the finances of the house entirely in his grasp and
ruled his brethren by terror. The canons seem to have been peaceable
men. One of them, who afterwards became abbot, was chosen to
preach the visitation sermon before the bishop, an honour accorded to
very few houses 3 and such complaints as there were about the rest, with
one exception, were trivial. The discord of the house was entirely due
to the abb-ot, who, apart from his domineering behaviour, was accused
of employing sorcery to fasten guilt upon a member of the convent.
Moreover, he proved refraetory at the visitation, refusing to submit the
customary documents for the bishop's inspection. His object, as has
