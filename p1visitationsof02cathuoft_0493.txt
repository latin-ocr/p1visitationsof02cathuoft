LEICESTER ABBEY, 1440 210

Brother Ralph Seytone, at the schools.1

(9th. The abbot.) Brother William Coventre, the warden of the
guest-house, says that he heard the abbot say that the visitation of the
ordinary would be but a vain thing‚² for he would overturn on the
morrow what was ordained therein.

(12th. The abbot.) Also he says that the abbot basin his hand
the offices of the treasurer and cellarer, and, when he last gave an
account, he said that it were better that he should render no account,
because the convent ought rather to bein debt to him than he to the
convent 3 and he always receives the arrears of the stewards' accounts‚⁸
and renders no vreckoning of these receipts; and he says that all the
buildings of the monastery have been constructed anew at the common
costs and out of the alms‚ and yet the abbot says that he himself has
done all this.

(The abbot and the sub-prior.) Also whereas by the custom of the
monastery the sub-cellarer should receive for the use of his office all the
profits of the church of St. Martin of Leicester‚‘¹ which amount on a
yearly average to thirty pounds, now the abbot and the sub-prior receive
all and pay only twenty pounds, putting in their pocket the remainder,
whereof they give no account 3 and thus have they done by the space of
mne years.

(The abbot. 3d.) Also he says as above concerning the multiplier,
whose name is Robert‚ and concerning his serving-man Thomas as above,
and he says that this matter is noised abroad in those parts, and he fears
that by reason hereof the monastery will be made to lose by the king’s

5
Stewffiffe abbot.) Also he believes that the abbot should have a thousand

· pounds, if they be not wasted by this means.

(The abbot. 5th.) Also he says that there are fifty—two serving-folk,
seculars, within the monastery and in the verneyerde⁶ eighteen‚ the more
part whereof are not only unprofitable but hurtful to the monastery.

Also he says that the abbot has several such secular folk unknown
in his following, whom he savours to the utmost.

(The abbot. Belgrave. oth.) Also he says that the abbot received
five marks from Thomas Belgrave to the end that he should excuse him
from attendance in quire, and, after that he got well of his sickness and
could lift his hands to celebrate, the same Belgrave gave the abbot
