In the year of our Lord 1274 it was provided and granted by
dan Ralph⁵ the abbot and the convent that the almoner should keep two
horses in the stable ior the need of the monks when they set out on a
journey, to wit, a palfrey and a horse to carry a pack with all their equip-
ment. And this same appointment was made concerning the pittancer.⁶
Also it was provided that the master oi the work should keep at least

r* one horse in the stable with its equipment. Moreover it was decreed

that the chamberlain should always keep six comely [travelling-]cloaks
for the need of the monks and seemly shoes of cow-hide and two comely
saddles for the two palfreys and one for the pack-horse, and a bare-hide⁷
for the advantage of the monks when they go a journey. ·

Hermitage. It appears to have served the spiritual needs of the tenants of Croyland at

⁶ Ralph Mersh‚ abbot 1254- -81. It was probably during his abbacy that the sculpture
of the beautiful west front of the abbey church was completed. The upper portion with
its statuary‚ as we now see it, was entirely reconstructed towards the close of the fourteenth
cmmargee Visitatmns, Ι, 243, note on Pietanciarius.

⁷ The‘ bare· hide‘ was a hide covering for the pack carried by the sumpter mule‚‘ to
serve as tarpaulins now do (Fowler, Βανά. Acct. Rolls [Surt. Soc.] 111, 893). Numerous
entries relating to bare· hides occur in the Durham rolls, e. g. Ι, 90: ‘Et sol. .pro tanna-
cione et domacione 6 coriorum bovin proj Barehide‚ una cum 25. 6d. solut. pro factura et
suicione ejusdem, 18s.’. The bare— hide of the prior on a journey to and from Warkworth
is mentioned ibid. 111, 177, probably meaning his pack of luggage under the convoy os a
servant, William Fon. Cf. ibid.. ΙΙ, 536, ‘’In factura unius novi Clathseck cum Barehud
pro dorhino Priore cum braces ad idem, 5s.’‚ where the bare— hide obviously was the outer
covering of the eloth sack and the brac’es were the straps used to fasten it to the saddle.
Larger ebare· hides were used to cover cans, e. g ibid„ 11, 566, 582. Possibly bear· skins
were ogigligally used for this purpose, but the name seems to imply more obviously a
