LEICEHER, NEW commis, 1440 200

officiant of the service, withhold their presence of a night from such
matins, saying that they prefer rather to bear the penalty inflicted by the
same statutes upon such that are absent than to leave their night’s rest,
we enjoin upon you all and several that now are and shall be, under pain
of excommunication‚ which we intend to pronounce against your several
persons who go counter to these our injunctions or any of them know-
ingly and with obstinate intent, apart from the mark and guilt of perjury
which they that keep not the said statutes incur, that all and several the
canons present in the college who are not lawfully hindered, according
to the meaning of the statuteS‚¹ do rise and be present at the same, but at
least four in· number according to the requirement of the statutes afore-
said.2

’ Also we enjoin upon you in the form aforesaid and under the penalty
whereof note is made above, that you chant the divine office by night
and by day, to wit, matins, vespers and the other canonical hours and
masses and what else you are of duty or by statute bound to say, which
should be chanted in quire and elsewhere, as slowly as you may with due
devotion and with the pauses in psalm-singing‚ not hasting or skipping
or slurring, as devoutly as ever God shall grant you, nor in psalm-singing
let the second part of the verse be in any wise begun before that the
first part is altogether finished ; and that each one of you, when he says
⁴ his devotions or the other canonical hours in time of divine service, say
them in so low a voice that he may in no wise‚ as he so says them,
disturb or hinder by any noise them that are singing next to him ; and
whosoever from henceforward is found making such disturbance or
hindrance, let him pay to the sacrist‚ within the three days immediately
after his conviction in chapter touching this, fourpence to the fabric fund
of that church and sixpence to be converted to the uses of the poor folk
of the hospital in the same place out of the portion of his prebend, every

time that he shall so offend.³

Also we enJ'oin upon you the dean and the dean’s lieutenant and the
sacrist and the rest of the ministers of the same church, to whom by
reason of their offices it belongs to correct or take note of any defaults
whatsoever, that you diligently without any favour or malice and faith-
fully take note of the defaults of any that are in quire and are absent
from quire according to the form of the statutes, and report them to the
president in the next chapters to be celebrated in succession thereafter,
and exact the fines or penalties in money of such defaults without any
remission, and convert them to the due uses as the statutes require, with-
out any help to them that owe them from the kindness of the presidents
or of them that exact payment, inasmuch as readiness to pardon some-
times gives encouragement to transgression.4
