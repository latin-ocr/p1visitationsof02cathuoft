 

GRACEDIEU PRIORY, 1447-ss 128

Margaret, coming to you, besought leave to migrate to the said priory of

St. Margaret and her absolution from the obedience due to you the
prioreSS‚ you, the prioress and convent of Gracedieu aforesaid, paying no
heed to the honest zeal and devout purpose of the aforesaid sister
Margaret, did refuse to grant her such licence or release her from such
Ῐῑ] obedience, taking away from her unduly and keeping back such letters
which had been granted her by the said prioress and convent of the
ΪῖῘ house of St. Margaret aforesaid. Wherefore considering that it would
in this case be allowed according to the sanctions of the canonsl that she
ἦ should have power to migrate and take flight from the slighter form of
religion to the more advanced for the sake of the stricter and harder life,
provided that no ill report or loss should arise thereout or follow in any

'way whatsoever to the same your priory, we straitly enjoin and command

[2. you, as soon as you have seen these presents, to restore the letters which
you have taken away from the same sister Margaret to her and suffer her
4, to have free passage, with your licence under letters sealed with your
[- common seal, to the priory of St. Margaret aforesaid, in case that it be of
³1 a stricter order of religion, or take order to certify us authentically and
·· surely inform us, on this side the feast of the purification of blessed

Mary the virgin next to come, why you should not suffer her so to pass.
Given under our seal ad causas in our castle of Sleaford on the twelfth
ff day of the month of January, in the year of our Lord 14462 and the
» twenty-first year of our consecration and the eleventh of our translation!

Now, after the receipt of these reverend letters and careful inspec-
tion of them, we do your fatherhood to wit that those letters which are
named in your reverend letters and were addressed by the said lady
prioress and the convent of the priory of the nuns of St. Margaret, of

x our said diocese, to be conveyed specially to us on behalf of the said

argaret Crosse, our fellow nun and sister, as he who looks therein may
clearly see from the purport of the same, we have not taken away from
'her but received them as letters of our own presented to us on behalf of the
Margaret Crosse of her own free-will, to be held by us in safe keeping.
Moreover‚ reverend father in Christ aforesaid, albeit the priory of the
nuns of St. Margaret aforesaid is alleged to be of a straiter religious
order and observance‚ nevertheless that this is so our party does not

Ἰ allow but demurs that it is altogether harder. The said Margaret Crosse,

however, desires her transference from our priory to the said priory of
St. Margaret, not that she may lead a life altogether and entirely harder,
but that she may lead a life of less restraint, from some presumption or light-
ness or at any rate from fieshly impulse, to the loss or ill repute of our
