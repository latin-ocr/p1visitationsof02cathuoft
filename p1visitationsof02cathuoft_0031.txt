never rose to eminence upon its more restricted lines. Again on 6 July,
1448, letters patent were issued to the second earl of Northumberland‚
bishop Alnwick, Henry Percy, lord Poynings‚ and a lawyer named John
Lematon, licensing the foundation of the chantry of St. Mary, already
referred to, in St. Michael's at Alnwick. Here there were to be two
chaplainS‚ one of whom was to keep a free grammar-school for poor
boys ; and the maintenance οἱ such poor scholars is specially emphasised

they were to be nominated for presentation by the burgesses of the
town.² While, therefore. Alnwick was on the one hand an implacable
foe of the popular heresies which assumed eccentric and fantastic forms
among the poor and uneducated‚ he also took a prominent place among
the ecclesiastics who saw in a sound orthodox education an antidote to
novelties of doctrine. The provisions of his will display his interest in
the universities of Oxford and Cambridge alike, his preference for priests
who had a university education, and his anxiety for the proper instrue-
tion of the young of his private household. One instance of his approval
of religious movements in his own diocese is the part which he took as
principal founder of the guild of St. Mary at Louth‚ established by the
townsfolk in 1446-7.2

His episcopate at Norwich and at Lincoln left its mark upon the
cathedral church in one place and the bishops palaces in both citieS.
The shallow porch which covers the twelfth-eentury western doorway
at Norwich was added under his mle, to which period also the comple-
tion of the cloister‚ including the north walk next the church, belongs.
He built the existing gatehouse of the palace and provided in his will
for the cost of the great west window of the cathedral church, which
was executed in the time of bishop‘ Lyhart (1446-72).⁸ At Lincoln he is
remembered by his additions to the palaee. The gate-tower in which
the episcopal muniments are preserved, at the north-east angle of the
ruined great hall, is still known as the Alnwick tower 3 while to the east
os the tower he added the chapel and the small dining-room below with
its adjacent cellars to existing thirteenth-century buildings. The bay
window of the great hall and other alterations and additions were also
probably due to him.41 The various late Gothic insertions in the west
front of the cathedral church, although their date is not very well
established, had probably been finished before his time3 but he was
buried close to the west end of the nave, where his grave is marked by
a modern brass inscription.⁵ He gave to the minster the great silver-
gilt processional cross and the blue velvet eope with gold orphreys‚
ornamented on the hood and back with images of the Holy Trinity and
the Assumption wrought with pearls and precious stoneS‚ which were
among the treasure of the church in 1536.⁰
