month of July in the year Of our Lord 1440, and the fourteenth year Of
our consecration and the fourth of our translation.

A DEPRECATORY LETTER FOR A MONK OF THE HOUSE OF BARDNEY
THAT HE MAY STAY AT HUMBERSTONE.

William, etc., to our beloved sons in Christ the abbot and convent
of the monastery Of Bardney, Of the order Of St. Benet, of our diocese,
health, grace and blessing. At another time, for the reform of the estate
Of the monastery Of Humberstone, of the said order and our diocese,
which in matters spiritual and temporal had come tO grievous decay, we
preferred for a time our beloved son William Wayneflete, a fellow-
monk and brother Of you and your said monastery, to the rule of the said
monastery Of Humberstone, after that the special licence necessary in
this behalf had been obtained from you the abbot by the same. And
seeing that you, doing a special favour to the same brother William, did
at our request grant indulgence to the same, to the end that, Whensoever
the said brother William, within the space of two years immediately
following upon the said preferment, will return to you and your mon-
astery, you would favourably admit him to his erstwhile estate in the
same, now therefore that such space of two years is well-nigh past, and
that the said monastery of Humberstone has manifestly been bettered by
the presidency Of the same brother William, and as we have confident
hope Of the further reform thereof, if he may be able to make provision
for the same for some time longer, we ask your loving-kindnesses that
you will prorogue and extend such your favour, which, as is aforeset, you
have granted to the said brother William, until the feast Of the Annun-
eiation of blessed Mary next in a year's time to come,1 and admit the
same from that time, when he shall have returned tO you, into your
convent. Given under our seal ad causas in our manor of N ettleham on
the eleventh day of the month of February, in the year of our Lord
1444, andl the [nineteenth] year Of our consecration and the ninth Of
our trans ation.

THE VlslTATION OF THE PRIORY OF THE CANONS OF THE CONVEENTUAL
CHURCH OF BLESSED MARY OF HUNTINGDON, OF THE ORDER
OF ST. AUST1N‚ OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN
THE CHAPTER-HOUSE THEREOF ON THE 15TH DAY OF THE MONTH
OF OCTOBER, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1439, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST ΛΝΒ LORD, THE LORD WILLIAM, ΒΥ THE GRACE
OF Gon BISHOP OF LINCOLN, 1N THE FOURTEENTH YEAR OF H1s
CONSECRATION AND THE FOURTH OF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting as a
tribunal in and on the place, day and year aforesaid in the business of
the beginning of such his visitation, there appeared before him the prior
and convent of that place to undergo, as was apparent, such visitation.
And then first and before all else the word Of God was set forth by the

record in the register of the preferment of Waynflete to the administration of Humberstone‚
but 1t probably dated from Lady day, 1443. Waynflete was at Bardney in 1437-8 (see p. 1 1
above), and was sub-prior in 1439-40 (see pp. 26, etc.) In 1444 (p. 32) his absence at Hum-
berstone 3⁵ mentioned. Whether William West, abbot of Humberstone in 1440, died or
re31gned m 1442 or 1442-3‚ is unknown.
