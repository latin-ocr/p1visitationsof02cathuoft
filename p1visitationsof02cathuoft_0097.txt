BARDNEY ABBEY, 1437-8 11

reverend father adjourned such his visitation even as it then stood until
the morrow, to wit, the twenty-seventh day of the month of January,
Depyng, Bug, Thorpe and I Colstone being present. Now in the mean-
time the same Depyng went to the infirmary and there likewise examined
brother William Waynflete, who was grievously ill,1 and after this he
went to the chamber of the sub-cellarer of the said monastery next the
kitchen² and there examined, first brother Thomas Bartone, the sub-
cellarer, and then brother William Bekeryng, and their depositions also
are written lower down. And on that morrow the said reverend father,
sitting in his capacity of judge as a tribunal in the business of such his
visitation in the said chapter-house as before, published the disclosures,
the depositions and the matters discovered by means of such his
inquiry, after report of the same had been made to him by the said
Depyng, and caused them all to be read in public and . . . . And
because among all the rest it was discovered in> such inquiry that
several monks were disclosed to him and informed against as touch-
ing sundry crimes and transgressions and defaults‚ he charged them
by virtue of his office with such disclosures and informations, and
in the first place brother Thomas Bartone, in that he was said to have
defamed⁸ brother John Hale, his fellow monk, of the crime of adultery
with the wife of the washerman of the monastery ; the which the same
brother Thomas expressly denied. Wherefore my lord appointed the
same brother Thomas a day, to wit, the twenty-seventh of the said
month of January, after nones, to wit,'of the same day, in the same
place and in his presence, to clear himself concerning such transgression

-.N with two monks his brethren and to do and receive what else he should.

Likewise he charged brothers Henry Lincolne and William Croyland
with the customary habit of drinking after compline; the which they
deny : wherefore they have the same term and place for clearing them-
selves with two monks each, etc. Also he charged brother Richard
Parteney with the acquisition of private goods⁴; which he also denies :
wherefore he has his term for clearing himself after nones of the same
day and in the same place with two monks. Also he charged the same
brother Richard with playing at dice ; the which he humbly confesses
himself to have done : wherefore my lord enjoined upon him that within
the next fortnight, beside the rest of his service and ceremonial duties,
he should say in penitential wise the first nocturn of the psalter of
David.⁵ Also he charged brother John Hole with the perjury of excus-
ing himself in his course from the celebration of mass for the king, to
the which each of them is sworn. He also charged him with the crime
of adultery and incest⁶ with Jane Raven, a married woman, of Bardney ;
all of which he denies: wherefore he has the same term and place for
clearing himself with three monks for each article. Also he charged
brother John Bracy with the crime of adultery with Ellen Cok, a married
woman, late of Bardney, now of Tumby ; the which he expressly denied:
wherefore he has the same term and place for clearing himself with
three monks, etc. Then, because it had been disclosed to my lord in

Ι ⁴ Proprietas is of course the technical term for this particular crimen. See Visitat'ions‚

⁰ The crime was committed in its first aspect as an ordinary offence ε the second aspect

was splrltual and was an offence against the monk's sacred calling. Thus, in Visitatians, 1,

83, an apostate nun’s transgressions are described as crimina sacrz'legzj et incestus spiritualis.
