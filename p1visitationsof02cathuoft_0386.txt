[iurauit obedienciam] et exhibuit litteras ordinum, videlicet subdiacon-
atus suscepti a quodam episcopo t[ransma]rino et sub eius sigillo, et
diaconatus a domino Γ homa Eliensi, et presbiterratus a domino Roberto
Londoniensi episcopo; sed non exhibuit titulum in prebenda p[ro eo
quod erat in¹] custodia magistri Johannis 2Turvey. Ideo suspensus est a
percepcione prouentuum prebende sue2 habet tamen terminum ad
exhibendum citra [festum] sancti Jacobi sub pena suspensionis a percep-
cione prouentuum prebende sue. Dominus Walterus atte Welle iurauit
obedienciam et exhibuit sufficienter 111 omnibus. [Dominus Johannes]⁸
Burtone, canonicuS‚ iurauit obedienciam et exhibuit sufficienter in
omnibus preter induccionem Dominus Robertus Careby‚ canonicus,
exhibuit sufficienter 111 omnibus.⁴¹ [Dominus Johannes] Burtone habet
terminum ad exhibendum· induccionem citra festum sancti Jacobi. Et
deinde dominus processit ad inquisicionem sub hac forma. Dictus
Burtone e[xhibuit] induccionem suam et dimissus est.

Dominus Thomas More dicit quod dominus Walterus Luffenham
occupauit per triennium possessiones collegii apud Irtlyngburghe‚ et
re[quisitus est] per decanum ad reddendum compotum; sed statim
prorumpit ad verba contumeliosa, et semper est inobediens decano.
Walterus [negauit]; et quo ad compotum dixit se obtulisse compotum
decano, et quo ad inobedienciam negat in licitis et canonicis. Postea
partim fatetur et iur [auit] peragere penitenciam et monitus est sub pena
expulsionis a collegio quod decetero obediat decano iuxta statuta, et
monitus est decanus.

Item vbi per statutum cauetur quod omni anno deputetur⁵ prepositus,
dictus Walterus occupauit per triennium; et cum vnus solus foret
[procurator] siue prouisor, iam contra statuta sunt duo, videlicet Luffen-
ham et Blokley.

 

long delayed. On 11 June, 1410, four canons were instituted, one to Lord’s vacant stall.
the others to stalls which do not seem to have been occupied before (Reg. xlv, ff 243d..244) ;

been founded. The first dean died in 14153 his brass (Richard Fryseby) remains in the

¹ Here, as in the greater seeular churches, the official title os each canon was ‘canonicus
ecclesie et prebendarius prebende in eadem.' By the foundation, the presentation to the
deanery, canonries and four clerkships lay alternately with the abbot and convent of Peter·
borough and the heirs of John Pyel. Thus two of the four canons instituted on 11 June,
1410, were presented by the abbot and convent, and two by William Hodelston‚ as repre-
sentative of the founder. Luffenham was presented in 1421 by the abbot and convent (Reg.
xvi, fo 5 5d ).

2 The word 15 uncertain, but transmarino is certainly the only one which seems to suit
the context and what remains of the word. A suffragan with a title in partibus' 15 indicated:
he may possibly have been John‚·' Stephaniensis episeopus, ’who acted as suffragan in the
diocese of Ely, 14²4· 43 (stubbs, Reg. Sac. Angl„ p. 129).

³ Thomas Bourchier, translated from Worcester to Ely, 20 Dec„ 1443 and from Ely to
Canterbury‚ 22 Aug„ 1454.

⁴ Robert Gilbert, bishop of London, 26 Oct„ 1436, to 22 June, 1448. See V stlattonsI
