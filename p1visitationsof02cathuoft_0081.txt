ANKERWYKE PRIORY, 1441 3

of necessity, without asking any counsel or consent of the convent. She
denies the article.

[8.] Also at Alderbourne¹ she caused beeches to be felled at an
unseasonable time, so that they will never grow again, and so are
destroyed for good and all. She denies the article.

[9.] Also the prioress has never rendered an account of her receipts
and expenses, and yet she alone receiveS, pays and administers
everything, even dispatching weighty business and leases‚ without any
communication with the convent ; and whereas she says that at the time
οἱ her installation the house was three hundred marks in debt, this
deponent says outright that then it was only thirty pounds in debt, and
this amount was paid from other sources and in no wise from the goods
of the prioress or priory. She confesses that she never has rendered an
account: she confesses also that she alone has received and does
administer everything without the knowledge of the convent. She
denies that she has made leases‚ unless with the knowledge of the
convent.

10. Also she caused a wood called Rowel, situated at Parnysshe,2 to
be felled unseasonably, suffering the boughs to remain after felling‚ by

L ’ reason whereof it is not likely that the wood will grow again to the

profit of foll< now living. She denies the article.
11. (see 1). Also she says that the prioress has destroyed an entry,
to wit a gatehouse‚ through the which needful stuff was brought in and

· pease-pods³ and other draff were carried out, and now that this entry

has been blocked up they are carried out through the church to the

great scandal of the house. She confesses the whole article, but says

that [she did it] for greater seemliness, to shut the pigs and other beasts

gut of the cloister, which formerly, coming therein through that entry,
id befoul it.

12. Also in the prioress’ default six nuns have now left the house in
akpostzitsy. She confesses that so many nuns have left, yet without her

now ed e.

13. ²{Iso she has appropriated to herself in the dorter four nuns'
places, and has blocked up the view Thamesward, which was a great
diversion to the nuns. She contesses blocking up the view, because she
saw that men stood in the narrow space close to the window and talked
with the nuns : she confesses the appropriation of the places.

14. Also the prioress wears golden rings exceeding costly with divers
precious stones, and also girdles silvered and gilded over and silken veils‚
and she carries her veil too high above her forehead, so that her fore-
head, being entirely uncovered, can be seen of all, and she wears turs of
vair.⁴ She confesses the use of several rings and girdles and silken veils
and the high cai-riage of her veils ; she confesses also the use of furs οἱ
vait}i hShe has sworn that she will reform these things, having taken her
oa t ereto.

⁴ Varium or varia pellis was, as its name implies, a variegated fur. Ducange, s.v·
Vares, refers to a parti-coloured species of mouse from which this fur was supposed to be
derived ; but it seems more likely that the name Varius was applied to the mouse sor the
same reason that it was applied to the fur. The real source of the fur seems to have been
the grey squirrel, with patches of the back and belly arranged alternately. Its use in
neraldry is well known.
