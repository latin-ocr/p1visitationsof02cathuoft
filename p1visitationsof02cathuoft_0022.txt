In the introduction to the volume of Visz'tations of Religious Houses
already published‚ some account was given of the career of William
Alnwick until the date of his accession to the see of Lincoln in Septem-
ber, 1436.² From the details of that account it will be seen that, between
his first appearance in 1411 as a papal notary until his consecration as
bishop of Norwich, very little is known of his life. He was clearly a
native of Alnwick in Northumberland. His early advancement appears
to have been due to Stephen 10 Scrope, archdeacon of Richmond,⁸ under
faculty to whom he received his appointment as papal notary in 1411.
Scrope was chancellor ot‘ Cambridge university in 1414, and it was about
this time that Alnwick began to pursue his studies at Cambridge. His
first ecclesiastical benefice was the church of Goldsborough in Scrope's
' archdeaconry. His institution to Goldsborough is not recorded, but on
3 April, 1415, he had leave of absence from his church for five years to
pursue his studies at an English university.⁴ He obtained the degree of
LL.D. at Cambridge and in 1420 was appointed archdeacon of Salisbury.
He resigned Goldsborough shortly after and on 3 May, 1421, received
collation of the prebend of Knaresborough in York,⁵ which Scrope had
held at the time of his death in 1418. As archdeacon of Salisbury
he succeeded John Stafford, subsequently bishop of Bath and Wells
and archbishop oi Canterbury, whom he afterwards succeeded in the
offices of keeper of the privy seal and dean os: St. Martin’s-le-Grand.
It is not clear when he first entered the service of the Crown. He

³ Alnwick's debt to Scrope is clearly shown in his will, where he ordains a five years’
chantry close to his grave for his own soul and that of the archdeacon. See translation of
the will below. Scrope died in 1418 (Le Neve 111, 139, 140).
