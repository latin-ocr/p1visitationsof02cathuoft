INTRODUCTION xxxiii

January). He seems to have gone to Liddington for the second half of
February, but was back at Lincoln, at the palace and at the manor
of Nettleham in March, and on 19 March was once more at Bardney.

On 28 March, 1438, the bishop was at Castle Bytham, travelliug south-
wards. On 2 April he passed through Stilton and Peterborough on his
way to London. From 10 to 13 April his documents are dated from
Windsor. Later on in the mouth and for a large part in May he resided
at the Old Temple. He left London for his house at Wooburn in
Buckinghamshire before 28 May ; and from Wooburn he came by way
of Northampton (7 June) to Liddington, where he arrived about 9 June

and stayed till the end of July. Here, however, the dates begin to be q

duplicated in the usual puzzling way. From 29 July, when we know that
Alnwick was visiting Ulverscroft priory, Liddington recurs sporadically
until 26 August, coinciding with Sleaford on 12 August and on 26 August
with Buckden. The bishop, on leaving Ulverscroft, appears to have
paid a visit to the treasurer Cromwell at North Wingfield in Derbyshire :
This is probably the meaning of ‘Wynfeld' (8 August).l He then
proceeded to Sleaford (12 August), and from here may' have held a
visitation of part of the archdeaconry of Lincoln. At any rate, he visited
Markby (19 August) and Spalding (21 August) priories, was at Buckden
on 23 and 26 August, and apparently in London on the 3oth. We lose

quarters until about 18 October: from 25 10 29 October he was at

Wooburn, in London from 13 to 17 November, and at Liddington
by 24 November.

We may assume that the Christmas of 1438 was spent at Lidding-
ton. On 1 February, 1438-9, the scene is changed to Nettleham. After
7 February, when the place, Sleaford, is probably genuine, there is some
confusion of date. Liddington prevails till the end of the month; but
the bishop actually seems to have left Sleaford on the 13th. He passed
through Oundle on the 14th, and probably travelled by way of North-
ampton to Wooburn, where we find him on the 19th. From this point
until the end of 1439, the dates indicated are as follows :

l March, 1438-9. 6-12, London ; 16-27 (1439), Liddington ; 30,
S eaford.

April, 1439. 1-8, Nettleham and Lincoln ; 9, Sleaford 3 13, Buck-
den ; 16-28, London. On 29 April there is a misleading date from
Stamford, possibly transferred by mistake from 1447.

May, 1439. 2-10, London; 17, Buckden; 20, Liddington; 23·27, Ι

Sleaford.

June, 1439. 1—3, Sleaford ; 8-23, Lincoln and Nettleham (visitation
of dean and chapter, 8-11.²) The end of the month is doubtful.

 

² This conjecture may be qualified by noting that in 1438 the possession οἶ the manor
of Wingfield was still in distante, as it had been since 1429, between Cromwell and sir
Henry Pierrepont. Cromwell did not obtain legal possession until 1441. when or soon
after which he began the splendid house in ruins of which remain. See the summary of
the history of the manor by W. H. Edmunds‚ Guide to We'nfield Manor, p. 11.
