FOTHER1NGHAY COLLEGE, 1438 106

brewing, fiesh, fish and the rest of the needful victuals for his household‚
and this every week. And, having heard these thingS, the same reverend
father, when he had removed the said John from the said chapel, took
counsel with the said master and fellows touching such the sayings and
depositions of the witnesses aforesaid and concerning the exceptions of
the same John Redburne against the said William Puttenham and Joan
his wife, the witnesses abovesaid, and their sayings, and how John has
offered himself for his purgatiori touching the removal of the victuals,
with the servants of the college and the purveyors of victuals of Foth-
eringhay, explaining to them that the witnesses brought forward touch-
ing defamation, etc., have proved nothing effectual against the same
John, save William Puttenham and Joan his wife, against whom, as is
aforeset, vehement exception has been taken, and that the witnesses
brought forward touching removal, etc., have proved nothing against
the said John, and yet he has offered himself for purgation. And so the
same reverend father moved them to set aside the heart-burning, where·
from he imagined that all these things spring, and conform themselves
to the likeness of charity, love, affection and peace. And then, having
called the said Redburne, the same reverend father persuaded him that,
since he is well known to have his living, raiment, and an annuity for the
term of his life from the said college, he shall henceforth obey the same
his masters in [all things] as is fitting, and that he shall pray them to be
good and gracious masters and loving towards him, and that he himself
will be obedient and faithful to thern. And so, with the hands of each
one joined to the said Redburne, they all at the asking of the said
reverend father remitted to the said Redburne all their malice and spite
and hatred, and promised him their good friendship in all things as is
fitting, if he behave himself towards them as he ought. And then in the

“ same place, before the said reverend father and the master and fellows
ς aforesaid, the same Redeburne sware upon the holy gospels of God

touched by him bodily, that he will be faithful to the same college and
the master and fellows of the same, and that henceforward he will not
defame the said college nor any several person of the same, but that, so
far as in him is, he will take order for and maintain the honest report
and honesty of thern all. And, when this oath had been thus proffered,
the same reverend father warned the same John Redburne a first, second
and third time peremptorily to keep such his oath under pain of his per·
petual expulsion from the said college and the final loss of his annuity
which he receives of the same, and also under pain of the greater
excommunication, to be levied against his person if he be lawfully con-
victed of the contrary. And because by the depositions of those
questioned in the business of such his visitation he found that none of
the fellows of the same college had kept the sworn statutes of the same,
but almost all were convicted, as it were, of the guilt of perjury in this
case, he appointed to the master of the said college the Friday next after
the festival of our Lord's Epiphany next to come¹ in the place of chapter
of the said college before himself or his commissary, to shew to the said
reverend father under their original form the statutes of the said college
together with 'the full state of the same college, and to leave with the
office of the said reverend father's registrar true copies as well of the
said statutes and state as also of the charter of erection of the same
