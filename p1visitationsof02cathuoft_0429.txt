LAUND PRIORY, 1440 178

the visitation ; the which having been read through in this form, ‘To the
reverend [father] in Christ,' etc, he also thereafter exhibited a register
of the house, wherein among other things is contained the foundation
charter of the priory.¹ T hen he displayed the letter in witness of the
confirmation of his electiori, drawn up by the present abbot of Owston,2
the commissary of master Robert Leke‚⁸ vicar general of the lord Richard,
bishop of Lincoln, specially deputed in this behalf,⁴ concerning
whose authority no mention is made in the said letters,⁵ but he did not
exhibit the certificate of his installation. He shewed also the state of the
house wherein it stood four years agone, but not since then. Thereafter
he exhibited the foundation chartei· in the original sealed letters. After
this, when the customary obedience had been sworn by him, the prior
on examination says these things which follow.

Brother William Northamptone,⁶ the prior, says that about four years
past they paid and granted three corrodies which consist in bread and
beer weekly and in kitchen stuff daily, for the which they received
eighty-seven marks and a half ; and they are worth, as he believes, about
sixteen or eighteen marks in the year.

Brother John Leche says that there is a great scarceness of canons,
because in his time 116 1135 56611 eighteen canons in number, and now
they are only ten; and, albeit he is in the infirmat-y, nevertheless he
abides at table with the prior for his better cheer.

Also he prays that a secular person be appointed to serve the canons
in the infirmary and to keep and watch over them.

Also he says that once on a time the canons of the house were
accustomed to celebrate annals and trentals.⁷

Also he says that women have over-much access into the canons’
church within the screens,⁸ and so near do they come to the quire-door
that the canons cannot go out without looking on them face to face : he
prays therefore that henceforward they may not come within those
screens, but may hear masses jn the nave of the church outside the
screens.

Also, since 116 himself is eighty years old and upwards, he prays that
my lord of his favour will dispense him from fasting in Advent ; and my
lord dispensed him according to his prayer.

 

 

⁷ Annals are the anniversaries or obits of deceased persons, held once a year. Trentals
are masses, with the office for the dead, extending over a period of thirty days, special
commemorations being held on the third, seventh and thirtieth days following the death or
its anniversary. See Ducange, s.v. Tricenarium, and Rock‚ Church of our Fatlzers, ed. Hart
and Frere, 11, 257-61. The unlicenced celebration of too many obits and trentals would
naturally interfere with the regular round of the convent's devotioris: this point is illustrated
by bishop Quivil’s synodal statutes sor the diocese of Exeter (1287), quoted by Ducange,
which forbid parish priests to take annals and trentals ‘ per que parochiales ecclesie officiis
careant debitis et quotidianis.' For the trental of St. Gregmy, a series of trentals lasting
over a whole year, see Rock‚ ut sup. Nicholas Hugate, provost of Beverley, d. 23 June,
1338, bequeathed ,6200 to sixty chaplains to celebrate for his soul throughout a whole year
(Beverley Chapter Act Book [Surtees Soc.] 11, 122-5)

⁸ l.e., the space east of the rood-screen and west of the pulpitum or quire-screen, forming
an enclosed vestibule or intermediate space between the nave and quire. The quire-door was
the entrance to the quire through the middle of the pulpitum. A portion of the twelfth
century crossing of the priory church and what appears to have been the south aisle of the
quire form the chapel of the fine Elizabethan house, called Launde abbey‚ which occupies
the site of the cloister and other buildings of the priory. The quire-aisle, mainly of the
fifteenth century, has been much restored, but contains a considerable amount of old stained
glass inserted in modern windows. See Assoc. Archit. Soc. Reports and Papers xxvn, 499,
500, for some notes on the house byJ. A. Gotch, F.s.A.
