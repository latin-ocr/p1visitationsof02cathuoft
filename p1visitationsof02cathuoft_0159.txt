BREEDoN PRioRY, 1440-1 42

the month of January, in the year of our Lord 1440, there being
present master Thomas Londone‚ John Bug and I Colstone. But
afterwards, to wit on the zoth day of the said mouth and year in the
conventual church of Langleyl, of the said diocese, the said brother
William Bryan appeared before Depyng and humbly sought to be
absolved from the said sentence. Wherefore after bodily oath
had been proffered by him to obey the law and abide by the
commands of the chureh, and especially to perform the penance to be
enjoined upon him, which is on this wise, that for the forty days forth-
with following he shall not go out of the bounds of the said priory, and
that every week during the next month, for the two days on which flesh is
eaten in the same priory, he shall be satisfied with one kind of flesh only,
he was then absolved, master Thomas Londone‚ notary and scribe,

being present.

WARNING TO ONE RESIGNING THE OFFICE OF PRIOR TO MAKE A
CERTIFICATE OF THE NAMES AND SURNAMES OF HIS CREDITORS AND To
MAKE SATISFACTION To THE SAME CREDITORS.²

William, by divine permission bishop of Lincoln, to our beloved son
in Christ brother William Horbury, late the prior of the priory of Breedon,
of the order of St. Austin, of our diocese, our canon, health, grace and
blessing. In our visitation as ordinary which we held of late in the said
priory, we discovered it to be disclosed to us and to be true that the said
priory, at the time when you had rule of the same, was and is bound
beneath the load of debt to several creditors in great and noteworthy
sums, and that at the time of your resignation, or at any rate after the
prefer-ment of the prior who now is, you did agree with the same prior
and promise the same on your word of honour that you would wholly
discharge the same priory of such load. And since, as we then learned,
some of such creditors, by reason of the non-payment of the debts of
this sum, do grievously harass daily the said prior who now is, we strictly
enjoin and command you in virtue of obedience and under pain of the
greater excommunication, which we intend to pronounce against your
person, if you do not that which we command, that within the space of
one month immediately following after the time of these presents you do
make specific declaration to the aforesaid prior of the said priory who is
now of the names and surnames of the several creditors to whom the
said priory ever since your time is bound, together with the actual sums
that are due to the same, and that you be careful to make satisfaction
to the same creditors of these sums that are due to them without
delay. Otherwise we shall proceed canonically against you as against
a despiser of such command. And you shall certify us with your
own hand of what you do as regards the premises on this side the
feast of the nativity of our Lord next to come. Given at, etc.
