FOTHERINGHAY COLLEGE, 1442 111

(The master.) Also he says that in the master's default the fellows

' are not furnished with their stipends for the masses which according to

the statutes ought to be celebrated by them.

(The master.) Sir John Puttenham says that the college is heavily
burthened with debt in the master’s default‚ for the fellows have no
certainty of what is received or what is paid; inasmuch as the master
does everything by himself without taking counsel with the fellows.

(The master.) Also he says that the master is of no account in the
governance of temporal affairs to the advantage of the college ; for all
things are going backward and are on the way to cease to be.

(The master.) Also he says as above concerning the excessive
retinue of the master when he goes out on business ; and he says flatly
that, unless the house be established in better govemance, it will speedily
fall into nothingness.

(The clerks.) Also he says that the clerks yeomen and gentlemen
as well, do wear their dress after the manner of lay-folk to the scandal of

the clerkly order and of the college.

(The master.) Also he says that there is owing to him of his stipend
[the amount] for a year and a quarter and for masses.

(The master.) Also he tells the reason why he did not render an
account, when asked by the master, for the year wherein he was steward,
to wit that about a hundred shillings are due to him from him who was
then purveyor,1 and he himself owes a considerable amount to other
creditors, and since the same purveyor is poor and insolvent, he fears
that the sum due from the pmveyor, which by reason of his poverty can-
not be raised, should be assigned to the creditors by way of payment.

Let my lord survey the barns and the other buildings of the grauge,
which are in need of very great repair.

(The master.) Sir Henry Stonham says as above concerning the
stipends and masses, that they are not paid, and the obits, ete, in the
master’s default ; as regards the masses and obits‚ at any rate during the
whole time of the present master.2

(The master.) Also he says'of the master's accounts that they are
not rendered according to the form os the statutes·

(The master.) Also as above of the manner of receiving and con-
veying the rents to the college.

(The master.) Master John White says that they cannot have a
copy of the statutes, so that they might be able to transcribe them.

(The master.) Also he says that the statutes are observed in part
and in part not observed‚ and this inasmuch as they are not known.

(All.) Master Richard Laxtone says that the servants come late to
quire, and, when they corne, they are irreverent, spending their time
irregularly in laughter and other profitless japes.

(Stonham.) Also he says that sir Henry Stonham goes out of the
college to the town by himself in an exceedingly suspicions manner and
often, haunting taverns and other suspect places. He denies the article
as it is put to him, and then he cleared himself of the charges with
Brownyng, Puttenham and Palmere.

(Thurlebyz White.) Also that women have too much recourse to
the chambers of Thurleby and White within the cloister, as above.
