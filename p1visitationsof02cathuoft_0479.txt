assigned to their prebends without repair and almost fallen to the ground,
we strictly enjoin and command you the dean, under the pains above-
said, to carry out diligently and faithfully the statute uttered touching
this, sparing no—one from being compelled to the repair of such dwelling-
houses according to the form of the statute}

Also, seeing that in the statutes aforesaid it is contained that the
gate-keeper of the close, >among the other charges of his office, should be
bound to bear the white staff in sign of honour before the dean and
canons at the time of their entry to high mass and when they go out
and during the whole time thereos, and at the time of matins, vespers
and the other canonical hourS, ,and while they cense the altars ; and the
gate-keeper who now is, lettin g these things go, gives himself to market-
ing; we strictly enjoin and command you the dean, under the pains
abovesaid, to compel the gate-keeper to fulfil his office, according to the
effect of the statute uttered touching this, by withdrawal of his stipend
[and] to apply to the uses of the fabric-fund of the church that which

successors, bishops of Lincoln; and that you suffer no public tavern to
be kept nor beer or wine or other victuals to be sold in any wise within
the site or gates of the college aforesaid.⁸

Als0, seeing that it stands disclosed to us that certain of the canons
of the said church are so busy with their marketing, with a view to
their hateful gain, that on that account they attend not divine service in
quire at the due hours, we enjoin upon you all and several the vicars of
the said church that now are and shall be, under pain of the greater
excommunication, which it is our will should be duly pronouncecl by you
