HUNTINGDON PRIORY, 1439 155

[he answers] that [he has answered] above. [He was] warned [under
pain] of excommunication to upbraid none of his brethren by reason of
their disclosures in such visitation‚

As for this, that he is [not] present in quire during divine service,
but roams abroad, and lies not in the dorter by night, he avers that he
is present at the hours like the others [and] that he lies continually in
the dorter, save in the autumn season.

As for very many books of the house, that they have been alienated
by the prior, he denies the article.

As for the wool of the house, that it is spun by the prior's mother
and other suspect women that are brought in to this end by the prior,
by reason of whom the priory is defamed.

As for this, that the profitable serving-folk of the house are cast
away by reason of the insolence and cruelty of the prior’s mother, he
denies the article. The prior has this day week in the church of
B[uckden] in presence of my lord or his commissary‚ to receive the
article in writing and to do and receive what else is lawful, there being
present Depyng, Thorpe and I Colstone.

Brother John Overtone commits adultery with Maud, the wife of
John Derham, otherwise Plummere or Clarke, who dwells by the bridge.¹
He denies the article and was ordered to clear himself with three of his
brethren.· Thereafter he cleared himself with Peter Oclee‚ John Mad-
yngley the prior, and² then he abjured the said woman and all familiar
intercourse with any person from that house, and was admonished under
pain of excommunication to observe his oath, etc.

He likewise went forth in apostasy in a secular garb with the prior
at the feast of St. Bartholomew. He confesses that he so went forth
clad in a secular gown of russet hue, which he put on under the constraint
of fear after he went out, for he says that he went out in his surplice only
with the other under-clothes of his rule. And, having heard these
answers, my lord says that he will take counsel against another time
concerning the further process against this Overtone by reason of his
confessions.

Now, having thus dispatched these matters, my lord, having reserved
to himself, even as he actually did reserve, the power of correcting,
punishing and reforming the matters disclosed and discovered in such
visitation‚ and of making injunctions, and also of inflicting against the
prior every penalty inflicted by law touching the matters disclosed and

discovered in this visitation and at other times as well, dissolved such
illisitatiom there being present master John Depyn g, Thomas Thorpe and
Colstone.
