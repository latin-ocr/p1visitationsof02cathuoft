IRTHLINGBOROUGH COLLEGE, 1442 157

Luffenham, the sub-dean, [sware obedience] and displayed his letters of
orders and his prebendal title.1 Richard Smyth sware obedience and
displayed the letters of his orders, to wit, of the sub-diaconate received
from a bishop [from over seas]2 and under his seal, of the diaconate from
the lord Thomas of ΕΙγ,3 and of the priesthood from the lord Robert‚
bishop of London⁴ ; but he did not exhibit his title in his prebend, [for
that it was in] master John Turvey's keeping.⁵ Therefore he was
suspended from the receipt of the profits of his prebend : howbeit, he
has a term to exhibit it on this side [the feast] of St. James, under pain
of suspension from the receipt of the profits of his prebend. Sir Walter
atte Welle‘3 sware obedience and made sufficient exhibition as regards
everything. [Sir John] Burtone, canon, sware obedience and made
sufficient exhibition as regards all things but his certificate of induction.
Sir Robert Careby‚ canon, made sufficient exhibition as regards every-
thing. [Sir John] Burtone has a term to exhibit his certificate of
induction on this side the feast of St. James. And then my lord proceeded
to his inquiry under this form. The said Burtone displayed his certificate
of induction and was let go.

Sir Thomas More says that sir Walter Luffenham has occupied the
possessions of the college at Irthlingborough by the space of three years,
and [has been asked] by the dean to render an account; but straightway
he breaks forth into wordsof abuse, and is ever disobedient to the dean.
Walter [denied it] 3 and, as for the account, ,he said that he had offered
an account to the dean, and as for disobedience‚ he denies it as regards
matters lawful and canonical. Thereafter he confesses in part ancl sware
to perform penance, and was warned under pain of expulsion from the
college that henceforth he should obey the dean according to the statuteS‚
and the dean was warned.⁷

Also, whereas by the statute notice is given that a provost should be
appointed every year,3 the said Walter has occupied [the provostship]
for the space of three years 3 and, while there should be only one

[proctor]⁹ or purveyor, now contrary to the statutes there are two, to
wit, Luffenham and Blokley.¹⁰

⁸ The prepositus or provost‚ corresponding to the vicedominus of early religious corpora·
tions, was the administrator of the goods of the college. The statutes of the Newarke
college, Leicester (1355) provided for the election of one of the canons as provost, with
tenure of office at the will of the majority, who acted as bursar and administrator of all the
goods of the college, save the oblations z see summary of the statutes in Assoc. Archit. Soc.
Reports and l’apers XXXII, 272, sqq. The most conspicuous examples of the office of provost
in English churches of secular canons are at Beverley, where the provost, although usually,
after the beginning of the fourteenth century, a canon of the church, had neither stall in
quire nor voice in chapter by virtue of his office ; and at Wells‚ where the revenues os the
fifteen-sold prebend of Combe were administered by the provost of Combe, osten called
provost of Wells. In foreign chapters the provost was frequently a dignitary. In the south
of F rance, as at Aix, Albi, Aueh and Avignon, he took the place of the dean. At Reims
he was premier dignitary, taking precedence of the dean t at Amiens, second, after the
dean. The four provosts at Chartres, whose offices resembled that of the provost of
Combe at Wells‚ were among the seventeen dignitaries, taking precedence after the twelfth.
In England, however, the title, although sometimes applied, as at Cotterstock‚ to heads of
chantry colleges, never became common3 and the most prominent examples of its survival
from the middle ages are the provostships of Oriel and Queen's colleges at Oxford, and of
Henry vx's foundations at Eton and Cambridge.

9 The original word has disappeared, but procurator fits the sense best and agrees with
what follows The office, which was obviously part of the duties of the provost, corresponded
to that of cellarer in a convent. The statutes relatingto the office of provost have not been
preserved.
