and in two more years with your favour Ι could be advanced to the
degree of bachelorhood. And naught do Ι crave of his maintenance but
his favour and fatherly succour. He encourages these your tenants to
demand sureties of me to keep the peace. And, between me and God,
they shall never be harassed by me or by any other man in my name,
for this was never my purpose, so help me God and His holy gospels l
And he himself alone is the cause of the whole disturbance, in that he

THE VISITATION or THE PRIORY OF DUNSTABLE, oF THE ORDER OF
ST. AUST1N‚ oF THE DIOCESE or LINCOLN, PERFORMED IN THE
CHAPTER-HOUSE THERE ON THE 24TH DAY oF THE MONTH OF
JANUARY, IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 14422, ΒΥ THE REVEREND
FATHER IN CHRIST AND LORD, THE LoRD WILLIAM, ΒΥ THE GRACE
OF Gon E1SHoP OF LINCOLN, IN THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR oF H1s
CONSECRATION AND THE SEVENTH oF H1s TRANSLATION.

In the first place, as the said reverend father was sitting in his
capacity of judge in the business of such his visitation, on and in the day,
year and place aforesaid, there appeared before him the prior and canons
of the said priory, in readiness, as was apparent, to undergo such visita-

Α tion ; and then, first and before all else, the word of God was set forth

by the honourable master John Beverley, professor of holy writ, after
this text, ‘Be ye prudent and sober, and keep watch in prayers’. And
when this had been finished praiseworthily in Latin, the prior delivered to
my lord the certificate of the mandate which had been addressed to him
for such visitation, after these words, ⁸ To the reverend [father] in Christ ⁹,
etc. ; the which having been read through, the prior shewed my lord the
certificate of confirmation of his election, but not of his installation.⁸
Interrogated concerning the letter testimonial of his installation, he says
that he never had one. Thereafter he presented the state of the house
and left it with the registrar. And so my lord proceeded to his prepara-
tory inquiry under this form. ‘

(All.) Brother John Roxstone, the prior⁴‚ says that the young canons
do not habituate themselves to study, reading [and] meditation, but to
vanitieS, at any rate [as regards] sitting in cloister after noon or occupy-
ing themselves with other honest works ; [the which they do not], but
stray to the kitchen‚ to the common hall⁵ or to the other outer offices
without any leave.

(Londone.) Also brother John Londone, canon not yet in holy

 

⁴ Only ten of the thirteen canons mentioned in the visitation gave evidence. Five of
these bear Bedfordshire surnames, viz. the prior (Roxton) and Barton, Bedford, Pavenham
and Rysley (i.e. Riseley). Barton probably came from Barton-in-the Clay, north of Luton.
:she name of Aston suggests one of the Buckinghamshire villages ot' that name, and Oundle
is, of course, in Northamptonshire. The editor cannot identiiy Beaupree (Beaupre) ε there
is an estate of this name at Outwell‚ near Wisbech, and another near Cowbridge in Glam-

urgan, but the name may be derived from one of the numerous places whose names are
corruptions of Beaurepair.
