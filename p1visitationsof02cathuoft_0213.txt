DORCHESTER ABBEY, 1441 (29

provide, and therefore it does not strike the hours by day and by night ε

,accordingly they do not rise at a fixed hour, but at the beck of the prior,

and the prior has applied the cords which belong to the same [clock] to
the church bells.l

Also the canons do often go out of the house to the public taverns
in the town and do use to drink and eat with secular folk in the same.

Also he says that, although he himself is stricken in years and is
therefore almost incapable of tasks out of cloister, nevertheless they have
appointed him to the office of kitchener. Notwithstanding it would be
disastrous for him to lay down the office before Michaelmas next, by
reason of the provisions which he has made in the same office.

Brother Thomas Tewkesbury says all things are well.

Brother Thomas Henrethe says that report was that brother John
Shrewesbury, a canon, had carnal knowledge of a certain woman, whose
name he knows not, in the bell-tower of the church. The man appeared
and, on the article being charged against him, denies all crime with such
woman since the time of the correction appointed by the abbot, the
which was his imprisonment in ward and confinement to cloister and
fasting on bread and water. Wherefore he was enjoined to clear him-
self with three of his brethren ; and then of my lord's grace he cleared
himself with two of his brethren and was acquitted.

The same says that the abbot has shewn no entire account before
the convent in common since he was elected abbot.

Brother Nicholas Plymmouthe says as above concerning the neglect
of the abbot to render an account,

Also he says that the tenements of the monastery in the town of
Dorchester are not in good repair.

Brother Walter Dorchestre says that all things are well.

Brother John Shrewesbury says that all things are well.

Brother Ralph Calethra says that brother John Wynchestre, late the
abbot,² receives from the house in meat and drink as much as two canons
receive, and seven pounds.

Also hc says that Marmyone keeps in the same every week sixteen
dogs for coursing, for the which he receives two pecks of barley a week
besides bran, and ‘five horses that are fed continually at the costs of the
house.

The same Marmyone has a chamber within the cloister, and, since
the doors of the cloister are in that place,⁸ they are left open almost
the whole night through, so that secular folk do use to run in and out of
the cloister all that time3 and all these things he is entitled to have
under the common seal.

Brother Henry Yorke says that all things are well.

'Brother John Wynchestre, sometime abbot, says of the canons that

⁶ they eat and drink in the public taverns in the town with lay-folk:

he craves therefore that an injunction be made under pain of imprison-
ment to them that do [so], for this the constitutions of the order require.

 

 

² There is no record of the date of 'Wynchestre's electiori or resignation. See Visita-
tions 1, 39-42, for details of an allowance made to the head of a house on his resignation.

³ This indicates that Marmyone's chamber was upon the ground-floor of the western
range, and may have been either the outer parlour of the cloister converted into a private
room, or entered from the parlour. Examples remain of such roomS‚ e.g. at Torre abbey,
where the cellar is on the left-hand side of the parlour and there is another vaulted
apartment on the right.
