CANONs ASHBY PRIORY, 1442 44

(Everdone.)1 Brother John Nauntwyehe,² the prior, says that brother
Thomas Everdone was sometime rebellious against him, but now has
changed his ways. He prays therefore that my lord make some sort of
injunction for the convent concerning obedience.

Also that my lord will bridle the heady importunity of the young
canons who crave to study at Oxford.3

(All.) Brother William Bukyngham, the sub-prior, says that, albeit
they are eleven in number, there are but four who attend quire in time
of divine service, while the others are busy with work out of doors⁴ and
spend their time in idleness.

(The prior.) Also secular folk do eat in the frater among the
canonS,⁶ where the secular folk see clearly in what wise the canons per-
form the penances enjoined upon them, to the offence of their house and
order.

(All.) Also he says that after compline the canons pass their time
in drinkings, watchings and other irregularities.

(The prior.) Brother Richard Coleworthe‚ the sub-cellares, says
that the prior and convent did sell to William Baudewyne and his wife
for the term of their life a corrody, for which they received fifty pounds.

(The prior.) Also he says that they did sell a certain wood to the
value of twenty pounds and upwards.

Brother Thomas Everdone, the kitchener, says that silence is not
kept in the due places and [hours.] Also as above, touching the secular
folk that do eat in the frater.

(The prior.) Also he says as above concerning the corrody, which
was sold for forty pounds, and concerning the wood, which was sold for
about a hundred marks⁶

(The prior.) Also he says that the prior leased out the church of
Thurleigh⁷ to farm for five years for ten pounds a year, and received the

whole of the farm there and then.
(The prior.) Also he says that he leased the church' of Culworth⁸

to farm for a period of three years at fourteen pounds a year, and in the
last year it was leased for seventeen pounds ; and he received the whole
farm of these three years there and then.

(The prior.) Also he has newly charged the priory with divers fees
to the amount of a hundred shillings or more, whereas its former charges
were no more than twenty shillings a year.

(The prior.) Also he maintains his father and mother within the
priory out of its common goods without the consent of the convent, after
the fashion of a corrody ; for the which nothing has been received.⁹

(The prior.) Also he did threaten the canons that, if they should

would habite favour on those who favour him. The prior was enjoined in

 

Ritibus Ecclesiae, 111, 260). Sir W. H. St. John Hope notes (Archaeol. sournal, LXVI, 307)
that the abbot. of a canons' house ‘ was allowed to entertain superior guests in the frater ⁷.

⁶ Everdone’s account of the sums was at variance with Coleworthe’s, his estimate of the
corrody being ten pounds less and of the money obtained from the sale of timber some ,640
to {50 more. Bishop Gray’s injunction on these heads will be found in stz'tations. Ι, 31.

7 See Vz'sae'tations, 1, 33, note 1.

⁸ See ibid„ 1, 34, note 3.

⁹ Nauntwyche’s predecessor had caused some complaint by the free entertainment of
his relations in the priory (Visitations, 1, 31).
