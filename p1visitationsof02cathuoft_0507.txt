Dame Alice Wakeley,²¹ the prioress, says that the nuns dO not lie by
night in the dorter because they are afeared of the ruinous state of the
same dorter.

Also she says that Agnes, sometime the serving-woman of Robert
fitz Elys, is a boarder with the prioress and pays eightpence a week for
her victuals. ’

Also she says that the daughter of John fiterleym steward of the
house, and Ingram Warland’s daughter are boarders in the house and
each of them pays fourpence a week.

Also she says that a man who is a secular is the cook in the house.

Darne Agnes Pidyngtone‚⁸ the sub-prioresS, says that Agnes Marcham,
a nun not expressly professed, of twenty-eight years of age, who also has
continued for twelve years in the habit of the professed, refuses to make
public profession.

Darne Alice Byllesdone says that all things are well.

Dame Joan Maynard says that the said Agnes Marcham is very
quarrelsome and rebellious and will not do her work like the others.

Dame Isabel Sydnale says that she herself lies every night in the
same bed with the sub-prioress.

Darne Christine Cordberde agrees with the sub-prioress‚ and she
lies of a night in the same bed with the prioress

Darne Agnes Marcham says that she entered religion in the same
place in the thirteenth year of her age and has stayed in the priory
wearing the habit Of the professed for thirteen years.

Also she says that she does not mean to make express profession
while she stays in that place, because of the ill-fame which is current
thereabout concerning that place and also because of the barrenness and
poverty which in likelihood will betake the place on account of the
slenderness of the place’s revenues.

exch. the church for Brighstone‚ I.W.‚ 18 May, 1455 (Reg. XX, ff. 279d.. 280). He acted
frequently as Alnwick’s commissary. He was probably related to Williarn Derby, arch-
deacon of Bedford‚ 1431=8 (see Visitations 1, 178-9).

'² Her electiori is not recorded (Visitations I, 157). Four out of seven nuns' names
appear to be place-names, of which Pidyngtone (Piddington) is near Bicester, and Byllesdone
(Billesdon) is presumably the place of that name in Leicestershire5 Wakeley and Sydnale
are uncertain.
