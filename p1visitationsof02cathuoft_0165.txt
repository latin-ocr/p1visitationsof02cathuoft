are made public to the secular folk in the town, insomuch that the same
secular folk make a mock of the same penitents. He prays therefore
that such penances be performed in secret.

(The prior.) Also this deponent did address certain letters to my
lord, informing him by them that the state of the house had come to
ruin by the sale of the corrody [and] of the copses, and by the letting of
the churches to farm and by receipt of the amounts there and then, in
order that he might reform such state3 and therefore the prior holds
him in prime detestation and has stirred up the vassals of the house to
hatred against him and his relations thereabout. Everdone was enjoined
to obey the prior in sign,1 word and deed, and the prior that he be not
excessive in his corrections with Everdone, but that he keep himself
within bounds.

Northampton and other places,² even when it is neither expedient nor
profitable, and this at great and excessive cost to the house.

the office of cellarer, borrowed of his relations and friends ten pounds to
